# 5.3 Compliance Posture (Non-Regulated, Decision-Support Only)

This section defines the CFO Business Intelligence Calculator Suite's compliance posture as a **non-regulated decision-support tool**. The product does not provide credit decisions, underwriting advice, tax filing, or investment recommendations, and therefore avoids most financial services regulations. However, disclaimers, terms of service, and geographic scope must be clearly defined to maintain this positioning.

---

## 1. Regulatory Non-Goals

The suite is explicitly designed to **avoid** regulatory burdens by limiting its scope to decision-support and excluding regulated activities.

**What we DO**:
- Provide calculations for educational and planning purposes
- Model hypothetical loan structures (e.g., "If you borrow $200K at 7.5%, your monthly payment would be $4,000")
- Present scenarios for user evaluation (not recommendations)

**Regulatory implications**:
- **Not subject to**: Truth in Lending Act (TILA), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Fair Lending laws
- **No licensing required**: Not a lender, broker, or loan servicer

- Determine borrower creditworthiness or risk ratings
- Provide automated underwriting scores or recommendations
- Access credit reports or credit scores
- Guarantee loan approval or specific terms

**What we DO**:

- Show warnings if ratios fall below typical thresholds (e.g., "DSCR of 1.18 is below typical lender threshold of 1.25")
- Provide context: "Lenders typically require 1.25-1.50 DSCR" (educational, not prescriptive)

**Regulatory implications**:
- **Not subject to**: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), automated underwriting regulations
- **No liability**: If lender rejects application despite favorable calculator outputs (our outputs are estimates, not guarantees)

**Disclaimer required**: "This calculator provides estimates for planning purposes only. Actual loan approval and terms are subject to lender underwriting."

### Not Providing Tax Advice

- Provide entity-specific tax optimization (C-corp vs S-corp, etc.)
- Calculate statutory tax liabilities (federal, state, local)
- Advise on tax credits, deductions, or shelters

- Show after-tax cost comparisons (e.g., lease vs buy with tax effects)

**Regulatory implications**:
- **Not subject to**: IRS Circular 230 (tax preparer regulations), state CPA licensing
- **Not liable**: For tax underpayment or incorrect tax filing (user consults CPA for formal tax advice)

**Disclaimer required**: "Tax calculations are estimates based on assumptions you provide. Consult a CPA or tax advisor for formal tax advice."

### Not Providing Investment Advice

**What we DO**:
- Provide valuation estimates based on revenue/EBITDA multiples (generic industry benchmarks)

- Educational content: "Strategic buyers may pay 5-6x EBITDA; financial buyers typically 3.5-4.5x"

**Regulatory implications**:
- **Not subject to**: Investment Advisers Act of 1940, SEC registration, FINRA regulations
- **Not liable**: For investment losses based on valuations from calculator

**Disclaimer required**: "Valuations are rough estimates for planning purposes. Consult a financial advisor or investment banker for formal valuations."

**GDPR/CCPA compliance**:
- Privacy Policy updates related to data processing require explicit consent (opt-in checkbox, not assumed acceptance)

---

## 4. Geographic and Jurisdictional Scope

### Initial Scope: US and Canada Only

**Why limited scope**:
- Tax rules vary by country (US federal + state, Canada federal + provincial)
- Currency handling (USD, CAD; no multi-currency in Phase 1 per Section 1.7)
- Regulatory complexity (EU GDPR, UK tax rules, LATAM financial regulations)

**What "US and Canada only" means**:
- Calculators use US/CA tax assumptions (e.g., 21% US federal corporate tax, 15% CA federal corporate tax)
- Currency defaults: USD for US users, CAD for Canadian users (auto-detected by locale or user-selected)
- No calculator variants for other geographies (e.g., no VAT calculators for EU, no GST calculators for Australia)

**Geographic detection**:
- Locale detected via `Accept-Language` header or user IP geolocation (for defaults only)
- User can override (e.g., US-based advisor working with Canadian client can switch to CAD)

**Block or warn non-US/CA users?**:
- **Phase 1**: No blocking (international users can use calculators, but results may not apply to their jurisdiction)
- **Warning**: Display banner: "This calculator uses US/Canada tax and regulatory assumptions. Consult local professionals for other jurisdictions."

---

### Tax Assumptions: Effective Rates Only, No Statutory Schedules

**What we provide**:
- User-specified effective tax rates (e.g., "Enter your effective tax rate: 26%")
- Default assumptions: US = 21% federal + 5% state = 26%; CA = 15% federal + 12% provincial = 27%
- After-tax cost calculations (e.g., loan interest is tax-deductible, reduces effective cost)

**What we do NOT provide**:
- Statutory tax schedules (progressive brackets, AMT, depreciation schedules)
- Entity-specific tax treatment (C-corp vs S-corp, partnership vs LLC)
- Multi-jurisdictional tax (state-by-state nexus, cross-border tax)

**Disclaimer**:
```
Tax assumptions are simplified effective rates. Actual tax liabilities depend on
entity type, jurisdiction, deductions, credits, and other factors. Consult a CPA
for accurate tax calculations.
```

---

### Currency: Single Currency Per Scenario

**Phase 1 constraint** (per Section 1.7):
- Each scenario uses one currency (USD or CAD)
- No mixed-currency scenarios (e.g., USD revenue + EUR expenses)
- No real-time FX conversion

**User flow**:
1. User selects currency at scenario creation: "Currency: [USD ▼] or [CAD ▼]"
2. All inputs/outputs in that scenario use selected currency
3. If user needs multi-currency analysis, create separate scenarios per currency

**Future expansion** (Phase 3+):
- Multi-currency scenarios (requires FX rate feeds, hedging assumptions)
- Additional currencies (EUR, GBP, MXN) with locale-specific tax/regulatory assumptions

---

### Future Expansion: Requires Separate PDR Per Geography

**New geography checklist** (before launching in new country):
1. **PDR required**: Full product design review (Section 11 template) documenting:
   - Tax rules and assumptions
   - Regulatory landscape (any licensing or compliance requirements)
   - Currency handling (FX rates, multi-currency scenarios)
   - Localization (language, date formats, number formats)
2. **Legal review**: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, disclaimers updated for jurisdiction
3. **Formula validation**: Ensure formulas comply with local accounting standards (IFRS vs GAAP)
4. **Partner review** (optional): Consult local CPA or financial advisor to validate assumptions

**High-risk geographies** (requires extra caution):
- **EU**: GDPR compliance (stricter than CCPA), VAT complexity, cross-border data transfers
- **China**: Data residency requirements, government approval for financial software
- **LATAM**: Currency volatility, high inflation, country-specific tax complexity

**Low-risk geographies** (similar to US/CA):
- **UK**: Similar to US (common law, IFRS accounting, straightforward tax assumptions)
- **Australia**: Similar to Canada (federal + state tax, relatively stable)
