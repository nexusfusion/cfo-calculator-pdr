# 4.4 Content Standards

This section defines writing and messaging standards for all calculators. Clear, consistent, professional language builds trust, reduces user confusion, and reinforces the suite's positioning as CFO-grade decision-support tools. All content must be accessible to non-finance users while maintaining precision for finance professionals.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### Input Field Labels

**Principle**: Use plain language, avoid jargon unless universally understood by target users (CFOs, lenders, founders).

**Good examples**:
- ✓ `Loan Amount` (not "Principal" alone, which is ambiguous)
- ✓ `Interest Rate` (not "APR" without context)
- ✓ `Loan Term` (not "Amortization Period")
- ✓ `Operating Income` (not "NOI" unless tooltip explains)

**When jargon is acceptable**:
- If term is industry-standard and target users understand it: `DSCR`, `NPV`, `IRR`, `EBITDA`
- Always provide tooltip explaining abbreviation on first use
- Spell out on first mention: "Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)"

**Input label format**:
```
[Field Name]
[Input box]
[Optional inline help text]
```

**Examples**:
```
Loan Amount (i)
[  $200,000  ]
Total amount borrowed, excluding fees

Interest Rate (i)
[  7.5%  ]
Annual interest rate (not monthly)

Operating Income (i)
[  $50,000/month  ]
Monthly cash flow available to service debt
```

### Output Metric Names

**Consistency across calculators**:
- Same metric = same name everywhere
- Example: "DSCR" in Business Loan Calculator = "DSCR" in Equipment Lease Calculator

**Standard metric names**:
| Metric | Standard Name | Alternative (Avoid) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Debt Service Coverage Ratio | DSCR | Coverage Ratio, Debt Coverage |
| Net Present Value | NPV | Present Value, Discounted Cash Flow |
| Internal Rate of Return | IRR | Rate of Return |
| Monthly Payment | Monthly Payment | Payment, Installment |
| Total Interest | Total Interest Paid | Interest, Total Interest Cost |
| Contribution Margin | Contribution Margin | Gross Margin per Unit |
| Breakeven Units | Breakeven Units | Breakeven Volume, Breakeven Point |

**Format**:
```
[METRIC NAME]  ← 14px uppercase, gray 500
$4,000         ← 48px bold monospace, gray 900
```

### Scenario Naming

**Default names**: `Scenario 1`, `Scenario 2`, `Scenario 3`
- Simple, unambiguous, automatically numbered
- Avoids technical naming like `scenario_001`

**User-editable**:
- Users can rename scenarios to describe purpose: `Base Case`, `Aggressive Growth`, `Conservative`, `SBA Option`
- Max 30 characters (enforced by UI)
- Alphanumeric + spaces only (no special characters except hyphen/underscore)

**Reserved names** (cannot be used):
- `Untitled` (used for unsaved scenarios)
- `Deleted` (reserved for system use)

## 2. Tooltip Style and Guidelines

### Length Limits

**Target**: 1-2 sentences, ~50 words max
- Tooltips should be glanceable, not essays
- If explanation requires > 50 words, use inline help text or link to help docs

### Tone

**Helpful, not condescending**:
- Assume user is intelligent but may lack finance expertise
- Explain terms without talking down to user

**Good examples**:
```
Loan Amount (i)
→ Total amount borrowed from lender. Does not include fees or closing costs.

Interest Rate (i)
→ Annual interest rate. Most lenders quote annual rates; this calculator uses annual rates unless specified otherwise.

DSCR (i)
→ Debt Service Coverage Ratio. Measures your ability to cover loan payments from operating income. Lenders typically require 1.25 or higher.
```

**Bad examples** (condescending, too technical):
```
❌ Loan Amount (i)
→ This is the principal amount of the loan you are borrowing.
(Too obvious, adds no value)

❌ Interest Rate (i)
→ The annualized rate of interest charged by the lender, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding principal balance, compounded according to the agreed-upon payment frequency.
(Too technical, overwhelming)

❌ DSCR (i)
→ Net Operating Income divided by Total Debt Service.
(True but unhelpful; doesn't explain why it matters or what values are good)
```

### When to Use Tooltips vs Inline Help vs Help Links

**Tooltips** (hover/click on `(i)` icon):
- Short definitions (1-2 sentences)
- Field-specific context (what this input means, how it's used)
- Always available, non-intrusive

**Inline help text** (gray text below input):
- Clarifications all users need (e.g., "Annual rate, not monthly")
- Format requirements (e.g., "Enter as percentage, e.g., 7.5")
- Critical context (e.g., "This will affect DSCR calculation")

**Help links** (external documentation):
- Deep explanations (> 100 words)
- Complex topics (e.g., "How is DSCR calculated?")
- Best practices (e.g., "What DSCR do lenders require?")

**Example combining all three**:
```
Interest Rate (i)                      ← Tooltip: "Annual interest rate charged by lender"
[  7.5%  ]
Annual rate, not monthly               ← Inline help
[Learn more about interest rates →]   ← Help link
```

### Examples of Good vs Bad Tooltips

| Input | Bad Tooltip | Good Tooltip |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Loan Amount | The amount of money you borrow. | Total amount borrowed from lender. Does not include fees or closing costs. |
| Operating Income | Your income from operations. | Monthly cash flow available to service debt (revenue minus operating expenses). |
| DSCR | Debt Service Coverage Ratio | Measures your ability to cover loan payments from operating income. Lenders typically require 1.25 or higher. |
| Breakeven Units | The point where you break even. | Number of units you must sell to cover all fixed and variable costs (revenue = expenses). |

## 3. Warning and Alert Messaging

### Warning Message Templates

**Info messages** (blue, informational):
```
Template:
"Your [metric] is [value]. [Context or best practice]."

Examples:
ℹ️ Your DSCR of 1.32 is above the typical lender threshold of 1.25.

ℹ️ Your cash runway of 12 months is healthy. Most advisors recommend 6-12 months of runway.

ℹ️ Your contribution margin of 40% is above the typical industry average of 30-35%.
```

**Warning messages** (yellow, caution):
```
Template:
"Your [metric] is [value], which is [comparison to threshold]. Consider [actionable recommendation]."

Examples:
⚠️ Your DSCR of 1.18 is below the typical lender threshold of 1.25. Consider reducing debt or improving cash flow.

⚠️ Your cash runway of 5 months is below the recommended 6-month minimum. Consider cost reduction or fundraising.

⚠️ Your breakeven volume of 1,200 units is 85% of current sales. A small revenue miss could push you below breakeven.
```

**Danger messages** (red, critical):
```
Template:
"Your [metric] is [value]. This may [risk or consequence]. You should [urgent action]."

Examples:
🚨 Your DSCR of 0.92 indicates insufficient cash flow to service this debt. Lenders will likely reject this application.

🚨 Your cash runway of 2 months is critically low. You must reduce burn rate or secure funding immediately.

🚨 Your pricing is below breakeven. At this price, you will lose money on every sale. Increase price or reduce costs.
```

### Tone (Direct, Actionable, Not Alarmist)

**Direct**:
- State the problem clearly: "Your DSCR is 1.18, below typical threshold"
- Don't hedge: Avoid "It seems like", "You might have", "Perhaps consider"

**Actionable**:
- Tell user what to do: "Consider reducing debt or improving cash flow"
- Don't just state problem: Avoid "This is a problem" without suggesting solutions

**Not alarmist**:
- Use measured language: "may face rejection", "should consider", "critically low"
- Avoid panic-inducing: "CATASTROPHIC", "DISASTER", "BANKRUPTCY IMMINENT"

### When to Show Warnings vs When to Block

**Show warning** (allow user to proceed):
- Borderline metrics (DSCR 1.15-1.25, just below threshold but not impossible)
- Unusual but valid inputs (600-month loan term)
- Best practice violations that aren't errors (cash runway < 6 months)

**Block with error** (prevent user from proceeding):
- Invalid inputs (negative loan amount, interest rate > 50%)
- Missing required fields
- Nonsense combinations (loan term 0 months, breakeven with $0 price)

**Example**:
```
Interest Rate
[  75%  ]  ← Red border
⚠️ Interest rate of 75% is extremely high. Did you mean 7.5%?
[  Continue anyway  ]  [ Fix it ]
← User can proceed but warned

vs

Interest Rate
[  -5%  ]  ← Red border
❌ Interest rate must be between 0% and 50%.
[ Calculate ] ← Button disabled
← User cannot proceed until fixed
```

---

## 4. Error Messages
