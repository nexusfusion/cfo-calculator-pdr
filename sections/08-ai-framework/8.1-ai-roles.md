# 8.1 AI Roles Across the Suite

This section defines the specific roles AI plays in the CFO Business Intelligence Calculator Suite, establishes clear boundaries for what AI does and does NOT do, and specifies required disclaimers for all AI-generated content.

---

## AI Philosophy

**Guiding principle**: AI-enhanced, not AI-dependent (per Section 1.4)

The suite's core value proposition is **CFO-grade calculation accuracy**. AI serves as an **advisory layer** that helps users interpret results and explore alternatives, but AI never modifies formulas, makes decisions, or guarantees outcomes.

**Key characteristics**:
- **Stateless**: AI does not learn from user data or remember previous sessions
- **Advisory only**: AI provides explanations and suggestions, not decisions
- **Optional**: All calculators function fully without AI (Free and Pro tiers)
- **Transparent**: AI responses always include disclaimers and hedging language

---

## 1. Explanations and Narratives

### Purpose

Help users understand what their calculated results mean in plain language, especially for complex financial metrics like DSCR, NPV, IRR, and cash runway.

### What AI does

**Per-scenario explanations**:
- User asks: "What does my DSCR of 1.42 mean?"
- AI explains: "A DSCR of 1.42 means your business generates $1.42 in operating income for every $1 in debt payments. Most lenders require a minimum DSCR of 1.25, so your ratio is comfortably above that threshold. This indicates the business has a healthy cushion to cover loan payments even if income fluctuates."

**Metric interpretation**:
- User sees warning: "⚠ Low margin detected"
- User asks: "Why is this warning showing?"
- AI explains: "This warning appears because your contribution margin of 22% is below the typical 30% threshold for sustainable businesses. At this margin, you need to sell significantly more units to cover fixed costs, making the business more vulnerable to sales fluctuations."

**Risk commentary**:
- User asks: "What are the risks of this loan structure?"
- AI responds: "With a 10-year term and balloon payment at year 7, you'll need to refinance or have significant cash reserves available in 7 years. Interest rate risk is a concern—if rates increase by the refinance date, your payments could rise substantially. Consider negotiating a longer amortization or smaller balloon payment."

**Plain-language summaries of results**:
- User requests summary of valuation results
- AI provides: "Based on your projections, the business is valued between $2.1M (conservative, using 8x EBITDA) and $3.2M (optimistic, using 12x EBITDA). The discounted cash flow analysis suggests a fair value of $2.6M, assuming a 15% discount rate. Key value drivers are recurring revenue (75% of total) and consistent EBITDA margins (28%)."

### Output characteristics

**Length**: 150-250 words per explanation

**Tone**: Professional but approachable, avoiding unnecessary jargon

**Format**:
- Plain paragraphs for explanations
- Bullet lists only when listing alternatives or multiple risk factors
- No tables or complex formatting (markdown not rendered in AI output)

**Language constraints**:
- Use hedging language: "typically", "generally", "may", "could", "often"
- Avoid absolutes: Never say "always", "never", "guaranteed", "must"
- Include contextual qualifiers: "Most lenders require...", "In typical market conditions..."

### Required disclaimer

Every AI explanation **must** include this disclaimer at the end:

> **Disclaimer**: This analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or professional advice. Consult qualified professionals for decisions affecting your business.

## 2. Scenario Suggestions

### Purpose

Help users explore alternative scenarios and optimize inputs without manually testing dozens of combinations.

### What AI does

**"What else should I test?" recommendations**:
- User completes a loan calculation
- User clicks "Get suggestions"
- AI suggests: "You might want to test these alternative scenarios: (1) A longer 15-year term to reduce monthly payments, though you'll pay more interest overall. (2) A larger down payment (20% instead of 10%) to reduce the loan amount and potentially qualify for a better rate. (3) Delaying the loan by 6 months to build more cash reserves, improving your DSCR."

**Parameter optimization hints**:
- User has DSCR of 1.18 (below 1.25 threshold)
- User clicks "Get suggestions"
- AI suggests: "To reach the typical lender requirement of 1.25 DSCR, consider: (1) Increasing annual revenue by 8% (from $1.2M to $1.3M) through price increases or volume growth. (2) Reducing operating expenses by 5% (from $950k to $900k). (3) Extending the loan term from 7 years to 10 years to reduce monthly payments."

**Alternative scenario ideas**:
- User using breakeven calculator
- User clicks "Get suggestions"
- AI suggests: "Consider testing these scenarios: (1) What if variable costs increase by 10% due to supply chain issues? (2) What if you offered a 15% early-bird discount to accelerate sales? (3) What if fixed costs increased by $5,000/month due to hiring another employee?"

### Implementation constraints

**AI never automatically creates scenarios**:
- AI only provides **text suggestions**
- User must manually create new scenarios and input suggested values
- AI does not have write access to scenario data
- This prevents AI from accidentally corrupting user data or making unwanted changes

**Suggestions are generic**:
- AI suggests percentage changes (e.g., "increase revenue by 10%"), not exact dollar amounts
- User applies suggestions to their specific context
- AI does not know user's business details (per privacy design in Section 5.2)

### Output characteristics

**Length**: 50-100 words per suggestion (shorter than explanations)

**Format**:
```
Consider testing these scenarios:

1. [Scenario name/description]: [Brief explanation of impact]
2. [Scenario name/description]: [Brief explanation of impact]
3. [Scenario name/description]: [Brief explanation of impact]
```

**Example**:
```
Consider testing these scenarios:

1. Longer loan term (15 years instead of 10): Monthly payments drop from $2,958 to $2,247, improving cash flow, but total interest increases from $105,000 to $154,000.

2. Larger down payment (25% instead of 15%): Reduces loan amount by $50,000, lowering monthly payments to $2,662 and improving DSCR to 1.58.

3. Rate negotiation (6.5% instead of 7.5%): Monthly payments drop to $2,788, saving $170/month and $20,400 over the loan term.
```

### Required disclaimer

Same as explanations (see Section 1 above).

## 3. Cross-Calculator Insights (Future Phase)

### Purpose

Provide holistic financial analysis across multiple calculators, helping users understand how decisions in one area (e.g., taking a loan) affect other areas (e.g., cash runway).

### Scope

**Out of scope for v1** (Phase 1-2 implementation)

**Planned for Phase 3+**:
- Multi-calculator scenario sets analyzed together
- Example: "This loan reduces your cash runway from 18 months to 12 months due to the $2,958 monthly payment. Consider increasing revenue or reducing expenses to maintain a healthy runway."
- Requires: Backend infrastructure to link scenarios across calculators, more complex prompt design

### Example use cases (future)

**Loan + Cash Runway**:
- User calculates a business loan ($250k at 7.5% for 10 years)
- User also has a cash runway calculator showing 18 months of runway
- AI suggests: "Taking this loan adds $2,958 in monthly expenses, which reduces your runway from 18 months to 12 months. To maintain 18 months of runway, you'd need to increase monthly revenue by $3,000 or reduce non-loan expenses by the same amount."

**Valuation + Loan**:
- User calculates business valuation at $2.5M
- User explores a $500k loan (20% of business value)
- AI suggests: "This loan represents 20% of your business's estimated value. Lenders typically prefer debt not to exceed 30-40% of enterprise value, so you have room for additional borrowing if needed in the future."

**Equipment Lease + Cash Flow**:
- User calculates equipment lease ($5,000/month)
- User has cash flow showing $8,000/month burn rate
- AI warns: "This lease increases your monthly expenses to $13,000, accelerating your burn rate. Without revenue growth, your cash runway drops from 15 months to 9 months."

### Technical requirements (future)

- User must explicitly link scenarios across calculators (opt-in)
- Backend API: `POST /api/ai/cross-calculator-analysis` with array of scenario IDs
- Privacy: No cross-calculator analysis for anonymous users (requires account)
- Tenant control: B2B customers can disable cross-calculator AI entirely

## What AI Does NOT Do

**Critical boundaries** that AI **must never** cross:

### 1. Never modifies formulas or calculation logic

- AI cannot change how DSCR, NPV, IRR, or any metric is calculated
- All formulas are hardcoded and version-controlled (per Section 3.3)
- AI only interprets results, never alters them
- **Rationale**: Calculation accuracy is the suite's core value proposition; allowing AI to modify formulas would undermine trust

### 2. Never makes credit decisions or underwriting recommendations

- AI does not say: "You should take this loan" or "You qualify for this loan"
- AI does not say: "This business is creditworthy" or "This investment is sound"
- AI **only** explains metrics and suggests scenarios to test
- **Rationale**: Credit decisions require regulated expertise; we are not lenders (Section 1.7)

**Example of prohibited language**:
- ❌ "You should accept this loan offer."
- ✅ "This loan has a DSCR of 1.42, which typically meets most lenders' requirements. However, lenders also consider credit history, collateral, and other factors. Consult a loan officer for a formal credit decision."

### 3. Never guarantees outcomes

- AI does not say: "This will definitely work" or "You will save $10,000"
- AI uses hedging language: "may", "could", "typically", "in most cases"
- AI includes contextual qualifiers: "assuming no changes to revenue", "if market conditions remain stable"
- **Rationale**: Financial projections are inherently uncertain; absolute guarantees expose us to liability

**Example of prohibited language**:
- ❌ "This strategy will increase your profit by 25%."
- ✅ "If you implement this pricing strategy and maintain current sales volume, profit could increase by approximately 25%, assuming no changes to variable costs or market conditions."

### 4. Never accesses or stores user PII

- AI receives only pseudonymous identifiers (session_id, user_id as UUIDs)
- AI does not receive: email addresses, names, company names, counterparty names
- AI does not receive free-text notes by default (redacted, per Section 8.3)
- **Rationale**: Privacy compliance (Section 5.2), minimize risk of AI provider data retention

### 5. Never learns from user data

- AI is **stateless**: Every request is independent
- No fine-tuning on user scenarios (we do not send user data to train models)
- No persistent memory of user sessions (AI does not remember previous requests)
- **Rationale**: Privacy compliance, prevent AI from inferring confidential business data across users

**Implementation**:
- Each AI request is a fresh API call with no conversation history
- No RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) using user scenarios
- Prompt includes only current scenario data, not historical data
