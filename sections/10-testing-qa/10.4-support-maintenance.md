# 10.4 Support & Maintenance

This section defines ongoing support procedures, bug triage, deprecation policies, formula update processes, and continuous monitoring/optimization for the CFO Business Intelligence Calculator Suite. Effective support and maintenance ensure long-term product quality and user satisfaction.

---

## Support Philosophy

**Goals**:
- **Rapid response**: Critical issues resolved within hours, not days
- **Continuous improvement**: Monthly reviews identify optimization opportunities
- **User-centric**: Prioritize issues affecting many users or core workflows
- **Transparency**: Clear communication to users about bugs, fixes, and deprecations

---

## 1. Bug Triage and Prioritization

### Severity Levels

**P0: Critical (System Down)**

**Definition**: System completely unusable, data loss, security breach, or payment failures affecting all or most users.

**Response time**: Immediate (within 1 hour)

**Fix time**: Within 4 hours or rollback to previous version

**Examples**:
- API completely down (all calculators return 500 errors)
- All exports failing (PDF/CSV/Excel generation broken)
- Login broken (users cannot authenticate)
- Payment processing failures (Stripe integration broken)
- Database corruption (data loss or inaccessible)
- Security breach (unauthorized access, data leak)

**Escalation**:
- Page on-call engineer immediately (PagerDuty)
- Notify engineering manager and CTO
- Incident response team assembled (engineer, PM, support lead)

**Communication**:
- Status page updated within 15 minutes ("We are aware of an issue affecting login. Investigating.")
- Hourly updates to users until resolved
- Post-incident report published within 72 hours

---

**P1: High (Major Feature Broken)**

**Definition**: Major feature broken, affects many users, no workaround available.

**Response time**: Within 4 hours

**Fix time**: Within 24 hours

**Examples**:
- One calculator completely broken (e.g., DSCR calculator returns NaN for all inputs)
- Exports fail for Pro users (Free users unaffected)
- AI requests timeout for all users (100% failure rate)
- Scenario creation broken (Pro users cannot save scenarios)
- Upgrade flow broken (users cannot purchase Pro tier)

**Escalation**:
- Slack alert to #engineering-urgent channel
- Assigned to on-call engineer or feature owner
- PM notified for user communication

**Communication**:
- In-app banner: "We are aware of an issue affecting [feature]. Working on a fix."
- Email to affected users (if identifiable, e.g., Pro users if Pro feature broken)
- Fix timeline: "Expected resolution within 24 hours"

---

**P2: Medium (Feature Partially Broken)**

**Definition**: Feature partially broken, affects some users, workaround exists.

**Response time**: Within 1 business day

**Fix time**: Within 1 week

**Examples**:
- One specific scenario fails (e.g., DSCR calculation fails only when revenue = $0)
- Export formatting wrong (PDF renders but formatting is off)
- Tooltip text incorrect (minor UX issue)
- AI narrative quality low for one calculator (responses are generic)
- Performance regression (p95 latency 200ms, was 150ms, still functional)

**Escalation**:
- Added to sprint backlog
- Assigned to feature owner or engineer with capacity
- Reviewed in daily standup

**Communication**:
- Support response to affected users: "We are aware of this issue and working on a fix. ETA: Next release (within 1 week)."
- No proactive user communication (only respond to support tickets)

---

**P3: Low (Minor Bug or Feature Request)**

**Definition**: Minor bug, cosmetic issue, or feature request. Does not significantly impact functionality.

**Response time**: Within 3 business days

**Fix time**: Next release cycle (2-4 weeks)

**Examples**:
- Button alignment off (cosmetic issue)
- Typo in warning message ("recieve" instead of "receive")
- Nice-to-have feature request ("Add keyboard shortcuts")
- Minor performance improvement (reduce API latency by 10ms)
- Documentation gap (missing tooltip for advanced metric)

**Escalation**:
- Added to product backlog
- Triaged monthly (prioritize by impact and effort)
- May be deferred to future release if low priority

**Communication**:
- Support response: "Thank you for the feedback. We've added this to our backlog and will consider it for a future release."
- No timeline commitment

## 2. Deprecation Policy

### Calculator Deprecation

**When to deprecate**:
- Low usage (<1% of total calculator views over 3 months)
- Replaced by better alternative (e.g., "Simple Valuation" replaced by "Advanced Valuation")
- Maintenance burden too high (complex calculator with frequent bugs)
- Regulatory changes make calculator obsolete

**Process**:

1. **Minimum notice period: 90 days**
   - Users have 90 days to migrate to alternative or export existing scenarios

2. **Migration path provided**
   - Alternative calculator recommended (e.g., "Use Advanced Valuation instead of Simple Valuation")
   - Export tool: Users can export all scenarios before retirement

3. **Deprecated calculator marked in UI**
   - Banner at top of calculator: "⚠ This calculator will be retired on December 31, 2025. Use [Alternative Calculator] instead."
   - Navigation menu: Calculator labeled "Deprecated" (moved to bottom of list)

4. **After retirement: Calculator removed from UI**
   - Calculator page returns 410 Gone (not 404 Not Found)
   - API endpoints return 410 Gone with message: "This calculator has been retired. Use [alternative] instead."
   - User scenarios preserved (not deleted) but calculator no longer accessible

**Communication**:
- **Day 0 (announcement)**: Email to all users who used calculator in past 6 months
- **Day 30**: In-app banner when user opens calculator
- **Day 60**: Second email reminder ("30 days until retirement")
- **Day 90**: Final email ("Calculator retired today. Export your scenarios now.")
- **Day 90+**: Calculator removed, 410 Gone response

**Example deprecation timeline**:
```
Sep 1:  Announce "Simple Valuation" deprecation (90-day notice)
        Email: "We're retiring Simple Valuation on Dec 1. Use Advanced Valuation instead."
Oct 1:  Banner added to calculator UI
Nov 1:  Reminder email (30 days left)
Dec 1:  Calculator retired, 410 Gone response
```

### Metric Deprecation

**When to deprecate**:
- Metric no longer relevant (e.g., "Simple ROI" replaced by "IRR")
- Metric calculation incorrect (cannot be fixed, requires replacement)
- Metric confusing to users (low usage, high support burden)

**Process**:

1. **Minimum notice period: 60 days**
   - Shorter than calculator deprecation (metrics are less critical)

2. **Replacement metric provided**
   - New metric replaces old metric (e.g., "IRR" replaces "Simple ROI")
   - Clear explanation of difference (why new metric is better)

3. **Old metric still calculated but marked "Deprecated"**
   - UI: Metric labeled "Deprecated" with tooltip: "Use IRR instead."
   - Exports: Include both old and new metrics during transition (60 days)
   - After transition: Old metric removed from exports

4. **After retirement: Old metric removed**
   - No longer displayed in UI
   - No longer included in exports
   - API: Old metric still calculated but not returned (backward compatibility)

**Communication**:
- **Day 0**: In-app notification: "We've improved [metric]. [New metric] is more accurate."
- **Day 30**: Tooltip reminder on deprecated metric
- **Day 60**: Old metric removed from UI and exports

**Example metric deprecation**:
```
Oct 1:  Announce "Simple ROI" deprecated, "IRR" introduced (60-day notice)
        UI: Simple ROI labeled "Deprecated (use IRR)"
        Exports: Include both Simple ROI and IRR
Nov 1:  Tooltip reminder: "Simple ROI will be removed on Dec 1"
Dec 1:  Simple ROI removed from UI and exports
```

### API Version Deprecation

**When to deprecate**:
- API v2 released, v1 no longer maintained
- Breaking changes in API (new authentication, new response format)

**Process**:

1. **Old version supported for minimum 12 months** after new version released
   - Gives API consumers time to migrate

2. **Deprecation warnings in API responses**
   - HTTP header: `X-API-Deprecated: true`
   - HTTP header: `X-API-Sunset: 2026-11-18` (sunset date)
   - Response body: `{ "warning": "API v1 is deprecated. Migrate to v2 by 2026-11-18." }`

3. **Documentation updated with migration guide**
   - Migration guide: "How to migrate from v1 to v2"
   - Breaking changes listed (authentication, response format, endpoint changes)
   - Code examples for v1 → v2 migration

4. **After sunset: v1 returns 410 Gone**
   - API v1 endpoints return 410 Gone
   - Response: `{ "error": "API v1 has been sunset. Use v2 instead. See docs.example.com/api-v2" }`

**Communication**:
- **Day 0 (v2 release)**: Email to API consumers: "API v2 now available. v1 will be sunset in 12 months."
- **Month 6**: Reminder email: "API v1 will be sunset in 6 months"
- **Month 9**: Reminder email: "API v1 will be sunset in 3 months"
- **Month 12**: Final email: "API v1 sunset today. Migrate to v2 now."

**Example API deprecation timeline**:
```
Jan 1, 2025:  API v2 released, v1 marked deprecated (12-month support)
Jul 1, 2025:  Reminder email (6 months left)
Oct 1, 2025:  Reminder email (3 months left)
Jan 1, 2026:  API v1 sunset, returns 410 Gone
```

## 3. Formula Updates and Validation

### When Formulas Can Be Updated

**1. Bug fixes (formula produces incorrect result)**

**Process**: Immediate fix

**Example**:
- DSCR calculation incorrectly rounds down instead of nearest
- Fix: Update formula to use Math.round() instead of Math.floor()
- Golden scenarios: Update expected outputs to reflect correct values

**Validation**:
- Compare new vs old outputs for sample scenarios (document differences)
- Get approval from product manager and finance SME (subject matter expert)
- Update formula library version (e.g., v1.3.2 → v1.3.3)

**Communication**:
- In-app notification: "We've fixed a rounding error in DSCR calculation. Results are now more accurate."
- Changelog entry with detailed explanation

---

**2. Formula improvements (better accuracy, new methodology)**

**Process**: Requires validation and notice

**Example**:
- Switch from simple interest to compound interest for more accurate amortization
- Add more precise DSCR calculation (include debt service coverage for all debt, not just one loan)

**Validation process**:

1. **Update golden scenarios to reflect new expected outputs**
   - Run all golden scenarios with new formula
   - Record new outputs (monthly payment, DSCR, etc.)
   - Update `expected_outputs` in golden scenario JSON files
   - Increment scenario `version` (e.g., "1.0" → "1.1")

2. **Run all golden scenarios, verify new formula passes**
   - Automated test: All scenarios pass with new expected outputs
   - Zero failures (if failures, formula has bugs)

3. **Compare new vs old outputs for sample scenarios**
   - Create comparison table:
     | Scenario | Old Formula Output | New Formula Output | Difference | Explanation |
     |----------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|-------------|
     | Typical SBA Loan | $2,958 | $2,958.04 | +$0.04 | More precise rounding |
     | Short-term Loan | $1,589 | $1,589.12 | +$0.12 | Compound interest vs simple |

4. **Get approval from product manager and finance SME**
   - PM verifies: Is this change intentional? Does it improve accuracy?
   - Finance SME verifies: Is new formula mathematically correct? Industry standard?

5. **Update formula library version number**
   - Increment minor version: v1.3.2 → v1.4.0 (new methodology = minor version bump)
   - Update `/src/formulas/version.ts`

6. **Document change in changelog**
   - User-facing changelog: "DSCR calculation improved for better accuracy. Results may differ slightly from previous versions."
   - Internal release notes: "Switched from simple interest to compound interest in amortization formula. Affects all lending calculators."

**Communication to users**:
- **In-app notification**: "We've improved the DSCR calculation for better accuracy. Results may differ slightly from previous versions."
- **Changelog entry**: Detailed explanation of what changed and why
- **For major formula changes**: Blog post or email to Pro/AI users explaining improvement

---

**3. Formula changes for regulatory reasons**

**Process**: Requires legal review and immediate implementation

**Example**:
- New SBA regulation changes DSCR calculation methodology
- Tax law changes affect depreciation calculation

**Validation**:
- Legal review: Verify formula complies with new regulations
- Finance SME review: Verify formula is correct
- Golden scenarios updated to reflect new requirements

**Communication**:
- **In-app notification**: "SBA regulations updated. DSCR calculation now reflects new methodology effective Jan 1, 2026."
- **Email to affected users**: "Important: SBA loan calculation updated for regulatory compliance."
- **Documentation**: Link to regulatory source (SBA website, IRS publication)

---

### Formula Update Example

**Scenario**: Improve DSCR calculation precision

**Before** (v1.3.2):
```typescript
function calculateDSCR(inputs: DSCRInputs): DSCROutputs {
  const annualDebtService = inputs.monthlyPayment * 12;
  const netOperatingIncome = inputs.annualRevenue - inputs.operatingExpenses;
  const dscr = netOperatingIncome / annualDebtService;

  return {
    dscr: Math.floor(dscr * 100) / 100, // Rounds down to 2 decimals
    version: 'v1.3.2',
  };
}
```

**After** (v1.3.3):
```typescript
function calculateDSCR(inputs: DSCRInputs): DSCROutputs {
  const annualDebtService = inputs.monthlyPayment * 12;
  const netOperatingIncome = inputs.annualRevenue - inputs.operatingExpenses;
  const dscr = netOperatingIncome / annualDebtService;

  return {
    dscr: Math.round(dscr * 100) / 100, // Rounds to nearest 2 decimals (BUG FIX)
    version: 'v1.3.3',
  };
}
```

**Golden scenario update**:
```diff
{
  "scenario_name": "Typical SBA Loan - Restaurant",
- "version": "1.0",
+ "version": "1.1",
  "expected_outputs": {
    "dscr": {
-     "value": 1.42,
+     "value": 1.42, // No change in this case (rounding same)
      "tolerance": 0.01
    }
  },
+ "notes": "Updated for formula v1.3.3 (improved rounding)"
}
```

**Changelog**:
```markdown
## v1.3.3 (2025-11-20)

### Bug Fixes
- **DSCR Calculation**: Fixed rounding error where DSCR was rounded down instead of to nearest. Results are now more accurate (typically within ±0.01).

### Impact
- Most scenarios: No change in DSCR value
- Edge cases: DSCR may increase by 0.01 (e.g., 1.41 → 1.42)

### References
- GitHub Issue: #234
- Formula version: v1.3.3
```
