# 1.5 Monetization and Business Goals

## Tiered Monetization Model

| Tier | Features | Limits | Pricing/Gates |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Free** | Single scenario per calculator; key metrics only (payment, total interest, basic cash flow); watermarked exports; ads/affiliate placement | 1 saved scenario; exports include watermark and "Powered by [Brand]" footer; advanced metrics hidden behind upgrade prompts | Free forever; no credit card required; encourages viral sharing via embeds |
| **Pro** | Multiple scenarios (up to 10 per calculator); advanced metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR, covenant headroom, sensitivity charts); clean exports (no watermark); scenario sharing with view/edit permissions; version history | 10 saved scenarios per calculator; 100 exports per month; no branding removal for white-label (see B2B tier) | $29-49/month (individual); $99-149/month (team, 5 users); primary conversion driver |
| **AI Add-On** | AI-generated narratives ("Your DSCR of 1.18 is below typical thresholds..."); scenario suggestions ("Consider extending the term to improve monthly cash flow"); risk commentary and warnings | 50 AI requests per month (to manage LLM costs); hard cap at 75/month; resets monthly | +$19/month (stacks on Pro tier); requires Pro tier; opt-in only; clear "AI advisory only" disclaimers |
| **B2B/White-Label** | Embeddable SDK with full API access; branding removal and custom branding; feature toggles (enable/disable specific calculators or metrics); per-seat or per-domain licensing; dedicated support; optional self-hosted deployment | Custom limits negotiated per contract; telemetry and AI can be disabled | Starting at $499/month (up to 10 domains or 25 seats); custom pricing for large deployments; annual contracts preferred |

### Free Tier Strategy

Free tier is designed to:
- **Drive SEO and organic discovery**: Free calculators rank for high-intent keywords ("equipment loan calculator", "DSCR calculator", "cash runway calculator")
- **Enable viral embedding**: Advisors, bloggers, and small business sites embed Free tier calculators, driving inbound traffic and brand awareness
- **Monetize via ads and affiliates**: Display ads (Google AdSense) and affiliate links (equipment lenders, SBA loan brokers) generate revenue even from Free users
- **Create upgrade friction**: Advanced metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR) are visible but locked, prompting "Upgrade to Pro to unlock" CTAs

Free tier is **not a trial**—it's a permanent, fully functional product with intentional limitations that drive Pro conversion.

### Pro Tier Strategy

Pro tier is the **primary revenue driver** for individual users and small teams:
- **Clear value proposition**: "Save 30-90 minutes per analysis, generate board-ready outputs, compare multiple scenarios side-by-side"
- **Target customers**: Solo CFOs, FP&A analysts, small business owners, freelance advisors
- **Conversion triggers**: Need to save more than 1 scenario, need to share scenarios with colleagues, need to present to board/lender without watermarks
- **Pricing psychology**: $29-49/month is cheaper than 1 hour of a CFO's time; $99-149/month for a team is cheaper than 1 FP&A contractor day

Pro tier should convert 3-5% of active Free users within 90 days (industry benchmark for SaaS freemium).

### AI Add-On Strategy

AI add-on is a **margin expander**, not a core product:
- **Target customers**: Pro users who need help interpreting results or want to save time writing commentary for board decks
- **Capped usage**: 50 requests/month limits LLM costs while still providing significant value (10-12 calculator runs with AI commentary)
- **Opt-in and transparent**: Users explicitly enable AI and see cost/benefit ("$19/month for 50 AI insights")
- **Revenue model**: High margin (LLM costs ~$2-5/month per user at 50 requests; $19 price = 75-90% margin)

AI add-on should be adopted by 20-30% of Pro users.

### B2B/White-Label Strategy

B2B tier targets **partners who embed calculators** into their own products:
- **Target customers**: Lenders (embed in loan origination platforms), advisors (embed in client portals), SaaS platforms (embed in accounting/ERP dashboards)
- **Value proposition**: "Don't build calculators in-house; embed ours and focus on your core product"
- **Pricing model**: Per-seat (e.g., $10-20/seat/month for 25+ seats) or per-domain (e.g., $499/month for up to 10 client-facing domains)
- **Feature differentiation**: Branding removal, API access, feature toggles, dedicated support, optional self-hosted deployment

B2B tier has the highest LTV (annual contracts, $5K-50K ACV) but longer sales cycles (3-6 months).

## Advanced Metrics by Category

**Advanced metrics** are the primary feature differentiator between Free and Pro tiers. By default, these metrics are **Pro-only** (locked in Free tier with upgrade prompts).

### Financing & Lending
- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**: Measures ability to service debt from operating cash flow
- **Covenant headroom**: Distance from lender covenant thresholds (e.g., "You have 0.12 headroom above minimum DSCR of 1.25")
- **NPV/IRR**: Net present value and internal rate of return for capital investments
- **Detailed fee breakdowns**: Origination fees, prepayment penalties, total cost of financing over term

### Cash Flow & Liquidity
- **Multi-scenario runway charts**: Visualize cash runway under optimistic, realistic, conservative assumptions
- **Sensitivity views**: "If revenue drops 10%, runway decreases from 9.2 months to 6.8 months"
- **Monthly cash flow waterfalls**: Detailed inflow/outflow breakdown by month or quarter

### Profitability & Pricing
- **Contribution margin**: Revenue minus variable costs, per product or service line
- **Margin of safety**: Buffer between actual sales and breakeven
- **Multi-scenario pricing charts**: Side-by-side comparison of pricing strategies (current, +10%, volume discount)

### Valuation & Deal Analysis
- **Multi-scenario valuation ranges**: Low/mid/high valuation estimates based on different multiples or DCF assumptions
- **Sensitivity charts**: "If EBITDA multiple increases from 5x to 6x, valuation increases by $2.4M"

### Planning & Scenario Modeling
- **Scenario comparisons within single tools**: Compare Base vs Aggressive vs Conservative side-by-side
- **Sensitivity views**: Show impact of key driver changes (e.g., revenue growth rate, gross margin, churn rate)

## Identity and Access Defaults (SaaS)

### Anonymous Users

- **Can use calculators**: Full Free tier functionality (single scenario, basic metrics, watermarked exports)
- **Tracked via session IDs**: Pseudonymous session identifier (UUID) stored in browser local storage
- **Exports stored 24 hours max**: Anonymous exports are temporarily stored on server for download, then auto-deleted after 24 hours
- **No cross-device sync**: Scenarios are saved in browser local storage only (lost if browser cache is cleared)
- **Conversion to logged-in**: Prompt to create account to save scenarios permanently, access from multiple devices, or upgrade to Pro

Anonymous access lowers friction for first-time users and SEO traffic. 24-hour export retention balances user convenience with data minimization (GDPR/CCPA compliance).

### Logged-In Users

- **Required for saving scenarios**: Cannot save scenarios or access them across devices without an account
- **Email + password or OAuth**: Support Google, Microsoft, GitHub OAuth for low-friction sign-up
- **Cross-device access**: Scenarios sync via cloud database (users can start on desktop, finish on mobile)
- **Persistent export history**: Logged-in users can access prior exports (subject to tier limits and retention policies)
- **Account dashboard**: View saved scenarios, manage subscriptions, download prior exports

Logged-in requirement for saving scenarios drives account creation (email capture for marketing) while preserving anonymous Free tier for SEO and viral traffic.

### Telemetry and Privacy

- **Pseudonymous IDs**: User IDs are UUIDs or hashed email addresses (not raw PII in logs)
- **Aggregated descriptors**: Log industry, business size, geography (US/CA), but not company names or individual identifiers
- **No PII in logs**: Logs never contain email addresses, IP addresses (hashed only), or scenario data beyond aggregated metrics (e.g., "loan amount: $50K-100K range")
- **Opt-out available**: Users can disable telemetry in account settings (loses access to usage dashboards and personalized tips)
- **GDPR/CCPA compliance**: Data deletion requests honored within 30 days; telemetry logs auto-purged after 12 months

Telemetry is critical for product analytics (conversion funnels, feature adoption) but must respect privacy and regulatory requirements.

## Measurable Product and Business Goals

### Suite-Level Goals

- **SEO traffic for target keywords**: Rank in top 3 Google results for 20+ high-intent keywords (e.g., "DSCR calculator", "equipment loan calculator", "cash runway calculator") within 12 months
- **Free → Pro conversion rate**: Achieve 3-5% conversion within 90 days of first use (industry benchmark for freemium SaaS)
- **Exports per session**: Free tier = 1.2 exports/session average; Pro tier = 2.5+ exports/session (indicates repeated use and value realization)
- **AI adoption rate**: 20-30% of Pro users adopt AI add-on within 6 months

### Calculator-Level Goals

Each calculator PDR must declare:
- **Primary business role**: Is this calculator a top-of-funnel SEO driver, a Pro conversion driver, or a retention/engagement tool?
- **Success metric**: What KPI determines success? Examples:
  - Equipment Loan Calculator: "Drive 500+ Free tier sessions/month from organic search"
  - DSCR Calculator: "Convert 5% of Free users to Pro within 60 days"
  - Cash Runway Calculator: "Achieve 3+ scenario saves per Pro user (indicates ongoing use)"

This per-calculator accountability ensures that each tool justifies its development and maintenance cost.

---

**Summary**: The suite uses a freemium model with Free (single scenario, basic metrics, watermarked exports) → Pro (multiple scenarios, advanced metrics, clean exports) → AI add-on (narratives, suggestions) → B2B/white-label (embeddable SDK, branding, custom deployments). Advanced metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR, sensitivity charts) are the primary Pro differentiator. Anonymous users can use Free tier; logged-in users required for saving scenarios. Telemetry is pseudonymous and privacy-compliant. Business goals focus on SEO traffic, Free → Pro conversion, export engagement, and AI adoption.
