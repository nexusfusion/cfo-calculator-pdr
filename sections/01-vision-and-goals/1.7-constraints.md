# 1.7 Constraints and Non-Goals

## What the Suite Will NOT Do (v1)

The following capabilities are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial release. These boundaries protect the product from scope creep, reduce development risk, and clarify positioning in the market.

### 1. Not a Full Accounting, ERP, Payroll, or Tax Filing System

The suite is a **decision-support tool**, not a system of record. It does not:
- Record or categorize individual transactions (use QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite for that)
- Maintain general ledger, accounts payable/receivable, or inventory systems
- Process payroll, benefits, or tax withholding
- Prepare or file tax returns (federal, state, sales tax, payroll tax)

Users input **aggregated financials** (total revenue, total COGS, total operating expenses) derived from their accounting systems. The calculators analyze these aggregates but do not replace accounting infrastructure.

**Rationale**: Competing with accounting/ERP systems is a multi-year, capital-intensive endeavor with low margins. The suite targets a different problem (decision-support, not record-keeping) and a different user (CFOs/analysts, not bookkeepers).

### 2. No Bank Connections or Transaction-Level Feeds (v1)

The suite does **not** connect to bank accounts or credit card accounts to pull transaction-level data. No integrations with Plaid, MX, Finicity, or similar aggregation services in v1.

Users must manually input summarized cash flow data (e.g., "total cash inflows last month: $150K").

**Rationale**: Bank connections introduce regulatory risk (GLBA, SOC 2 requirements), PII exposure, and complex error handling (stale credentials, MFA challenges, transaction categorization ambiguity). Manual input suffices for decision-support use cases and avoids these risks.

**Future consideration**: v2+ may add optional bank feeds for Pro tier users who want automated cash flow tracking, subject to SOC 2 compliance and explicit user consent.

### 3. No Automated Accounting/ERP Imports (v1)

The suite does **not** integrate with QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage, or other accounting platforms to auto-import financials. No APIs, OAuth flows, or CSV import wizards in v1.

Users must manually enter summary financials from their accounting reports (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow statement).

**Rationale**: Accounting API integrations are fragile (schema changes, authentication headaches, rate limits, inconsistent data quality across clients). Manual input allows users to "sense-check" data before analysis and avoids the support burden of debugging accounting system quirks.

**Future consideration**: v2+ may add CSV import or read-only accounting integrations for Pro tier users, subject to rigorous error handling and reconciliation workflows.

### 4. No Detailed Multi-Jurisdictional Tax (Only US/CA with Basic Assumptions)

The suite supports **US and Canada only** in v1, with basic tax assumptions:
- US: Federal corporate tax (~21%) + state tax (user-specified or default 5%)
- Canada: Federal corporate tax (~15%) + provincial tax (user-specified or default 12%)

The suite does **not** handle:
- Multi-country tax treaties, transfer pricing, or VAT/GST/HST reconciliation
- Industry-specific tax credits (R&D credits, renewable energy credits, film tax credits)
- Complex tax structuring (S-corps, partnerships, trusts, international holdings)
- Sales tax nexus, payroll tax across jurisdictions, or property tax

Tax inputs are **user-specified rates** or defaults. Calculators do not provide tax advice or optimize tax strategy.

**Rationale**: Tax complexity varies enormously by jurisdiction, industry, and entity structure. Attempting comprehensive tax modeling would require legal/CPA partnerships, frequent updates for law changes, and significant liability risk. The suite provides basic tax estimates for planning purposes; users consult CPAs for formal tax planning.

**Future consideration**: v2+ may add jurisdiction-specific tax modules (UK, EU, Australia) via partnerships with local tax software providers.

### 5. No Customer-Identifiable Transactions (Aggregated Scenarios Only)

The suite does **not** store or process:
- Customer names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers
- Invoice details, purchase orders, contract terms
- Employee names, SSNs, salaries (except aggregated payroll totals)
- Vendor names, payment terms, individual transaction amounts

Users input **aggregated totals** (e.g., "total Q1 revenue: $500K", "average customer acquisition cost: $120") without exposing individual customer or employee data.

**Rationale**: Avoiding PII reduces GDPR/CCPA compliance burden, minimizes breach risk, and simplifies data retention policies. The suite is designed for strategic decision-support, not CRM or HRIS functionality.

### 6. No Legally Binding Credit/Underwriting/Investment Advice (Decision-Support Only)

All outputs include disclaimers:

> "This analysis is for informational and decision-support purposes only. It does not constitute financial, legal, tax, or investment advice. Consult qualified professionals before making financial decisions."

The suite does **not**:
- Approve or deny credit applications
- Guarantee loan terms, interest rates, or eligibility
- Recommend specific investments or securities
- Provide regulatory filings or compliance certifications

Lenders may use the suite to **structure initial proposals** or **pre-qualify borrowers**, but formal underwriting requires additional due diligence, credit checks, and legal documentation.

**Rationale**: Limiting liability. The suite is a tool for finance professionals, not a substitute for licensed advisors or regulated financial institutions.

### 7. No Full Offline Operation (Connectivity Required for Exports and AI)

The suite requires internet connectivity for:
- Exporting PDFs and CSVs (server-side generation)
- AI commentary and suggestions (LLM API calls)
- Saving scenarios to cloud database (for logged-in users)

**Limited offline capability**:
- Calculators can run client-side with cached JavaScript (for brief offline periods)
- Inputs are saved to browser local storage (but not synced until reconnected)
- Exports and AI features fail gracefully with "Connectivity required" messages

**Rationale**: Full offline operation requires local databases, sync conflict resolution, and device-specific export engines—significant engineering complexity for limited user benefit. Most users have reliable internet; those who don't can work offline temporarily and sync when reconnected.

**Future consideration**: B2B clients deploying on-premise may request fully offline mode; this would be a custom implementation, not default behavior.

### 8. No Heavy Workflow Engines (Lightweight Prepared/Reviewed Metadata Only)

The suite does **not** provide:
- Multi-step approval workflows with conditional routing (e.g., "analyst → manager → CFO → CEO")
- SLA tracking, escalation rules, or automated reminders
- Role-based approval hierarchies tied to HRIS or org charts
- Detailed audit logs of every field change (v1 captures scenario-level edits only)

The suite **does** provide:
- "Prepared by" and "Last modified by" metadata
- Optional "Reviewed by" flag (user manually marks scenario as reviewed)
- View-only sharing (recipients can see but not edit)

**Rationale**: Workflow engines are complex, highly client-specific, and require deep integration with external systems. The suite is a **calculator**, not a BPM platform. Clients who need formal workflows should integrate the suite with existing workflow tools (ServiceNow, Jira, Monday.com).

**Future consideration**: B2B clients may request lightweight approval hooks (e.g., "notify manager when scenario is saved"); this could be added as a webhook/API integration, not a built-in workflow engine.

### 9. No Multi-Currency Within a Single Scenario (v1)

Each scenario uses a **single currency** (USD or CAD). The suite does **not** support:
- Mixed-currency scenarios (e.g., USD revenue + EUR expenses)
- Real-time FX conversion or historical FX rates
- Hedging analysis or FX risk modeling

Users with multi-currency businesses must either:
- Convert all inputs to a single currency manually before entering data, OR
- Create separate scenarios per currency and manually consolidate results

**Rationale**: Multi-currency modeling requires FX rate data feeds, hedging logic, and complex reporting (functional vs reporting currency). This adds significant complexity for a use case that affects <10% of target users.

**Future consideration**: v2+ may add multi-currency support for Pro tier users, subject to reliable FX data sources and user demand validation.

## Handling Out-of-Scope Requests

When users or stakeholders request features that fall outside these boundaries:

1. **Reject as out-of-scope**: Clearly explain why the feature conflicts with product positioning, technical constraints, or risk tolerance. Offer alternative solutions (e.g., "For bank feeds, consider using Plaid directly and importing summaries into the calculator").

2. **Break out as separate phase**: If the feature has strategic merit but is too complex for v1, document it as a potential v2+ initiative with its own PDR (Product Design Review) and risk assessment. Do not allow scope creep into v1.

3. **Escalate for risk review**: Features that introduce regulatory risk (bank feeds, tax advice, credit decisions), PII exposure, or significant technical debt require explicit approval from legal, compliance, and engineering leadership before consideration.

---

**Summary**: The suite is a decision-support tool, not an accounting system, tax advisor, or workflow platform. It does not connect to banks or ERPs (v1), does not handle multi-jurisdictional tax complexity, does not store PII, does not provide legally binding advice, requires connectivity for exports and AI, does not include heavy workflows, and does not support multi-currency within a single scenario (v1). Out-of-scope requests are rejected, deferred to future phases, or escalated for risk review—never accommodated via scope creep.
