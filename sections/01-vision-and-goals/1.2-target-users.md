# 1.2 Target Users and Contexts

## Primary User Personas

| Role | Need | Example Use Case |
|------|------|------------------|
| **CFOs / Controllers / Finance Directors** | Fast, defensible answers for board meetings, lender renewals, and strategic decisions | "I need DSCR projections for three financing scenarios before tomorrow's board call" |
| **Owners / Founders / CEOs (SMB)** | CFO-grade analysis without hiring a full-time CFO or FP&A team | "Should I take this equipment loan or lease? What's the cash flow impact over 3 years?" |
| **Lenders / Brokers / Advisors** | Quick pre-qualification and deal structuring tools with client-ready outputs | "I need to show a client three loan structure options with side-by-side DSCR comparison" |
| **FP&A / Analysts** | Repeatable, auditable calculations that don't require rebuilding models from scratch each month | "I need to rerun our pricing sensitivity analysis with updated assumptions for Q2" |

## Day-1 Usage Contexts

These are the initial "try it out" scenarios where users first engage with a calculator:

- **Pre-qualification and deal exploration**: A lender uses the equipment financing calculator to generate three quote options for a prospective borrower in under 10 minutes, producing a PDF that the borrower can review immediately.

- **"Can we afford this?" decisions**: A founder considering a $200K equipment purchase uses the cash flow calculator to see runway impact across optimistic, realistic, and conservative revenue scenarios—getting an answer in 5 minutes instead of spending half a day building a spreadsheet.

- **Quick margin and cash-flow checks**: A CFO preparing for a board meeting runs a contribution margin analysis on a new product line to determine whether pricing should be adjusted before launch.

- **Scenario comparison for strategic decisions**: An FP&A analyst compares three pricing strategies side-by-side (current pricing, +10% increase, volume discount tier) to see which maximizes gross margin while maintaining acceptable revenue thresholds.

## Day-2 / Recurring Workflows

Once users adopt a calculator, these become the routine, high-value workflows:

- **Month-end and quarter-end reruns**: An FP&A team saves baseline scenarios and reruns them monthly with updated actuals, exporting PDFs with version stamps to track performance against forecast. The calculator becomes a "living model" that evolves with the business.

- **Board packet preparation**: A CFO maintains three scenarios (base, upside, downside) for key metrics (cash runway, DSCR, contribution margin) and regenerates clean, consistent PDF reports for quarterly board decks. The standardized format reduces board member questions and builds confidence in the analysis.

- **Lender renewal packages**: A business owner preparing for an annual credit review uses saved scenarios from prior quarters, updates current financials, and exports banker-friendly CSVs showing covenant headroom and projected DSCR. The audit trail and version stamps provide credibility with underwriters.

- **CEO approval flows**: An analyst prepares a capital expenditure proposal using the NPV/IRR calculator, saves three scenarios (conservative, base, aggressive), and shares a view-only link with the CEO for review. The CEO can see all assumptions and toggle between scenarios without needing to open a spreadsheet.

## Permissions and Collaboration Scope (v1)

### Full Scenario Sharing vs Outputs-Only Views

- **Full scenario sharing**: A user can generate a shareable link that allows recipients to view inputs, assumptions, and recalculated outputs. Recipients cannot edit unless explicitly granted editor permissions. This is useful for collaborative review (e.g., CFO shares draft model with FP&A analyst for feedback).

- **Outputs-only views**: A user can share a static PDF or CSV export, or a read-only web view that shows final numbers without exposing editable inputs. This is appropriate for external stakeholders (e.g., board members, lenders) who need results but should not modify assumptions.

### Lightweight "Prepared By / Reviewed By" Metadata

Each scenario can capture:
- **Prepared by**: User ID and timestamp of the person who created the scenario
- **Last modified by**: User ID and timestamp of the most recent edit
- **Reviewed by** (optional): User ID and timestamp if a second user marks a scenario as "reviewed"

This metadata appears in PDF exports and audit logs, providing a lightweight approval trail without requiring a full workflow engine.

### What's Out of Scope

The suite will **not** include:
- Heavy workflow/approval engines with multi-step sign-offs, conditional routing, or SLA tracking
- Role-based approval hierarchies (e.g., "analyst → manager → CFO → CEO")
- Integration with HRIS or org chart systems to enforce approval chains
- Detailed audit logs of every field change (v1 captures scenario-level edits, not field-level history)

If clients require formal approval workflows, they should integrate the calculator suite with their existing workflow platforms (e.g., embed a calculator in a ServiceNow or Jira approval flow). The calculator provides the analysis; the workflow platform manages the approval process.

---

**Summary**: The suite serves CFOs, founders, lenders, and analysts who need fast, defensible financial analysis. Day-1 usage focuses on quick decision-support; Day-2 workflows emphasize repeatability and integration into month-end, board prep, and lender communication cycles. Collaboration features are lightweight and fit the calculator paradigm—shareable scenarios and outputs-only views—without attempting to replicate full workflow systems.
