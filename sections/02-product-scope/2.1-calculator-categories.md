# 2.1 Calculator Categories

The CFO Business Intelligence Calculator Suite is organized into five categories, each addressing a distinct set of business problems and decision contexts. These categories help users discover relevant calculators, guide product development priorities, and ensure consistent tier behavior within each problem domain.

## 1. Financing & Lending Intelligence

### Purpose

This category solves problems related to structuring, comparing, and stress-testing business debt. Calculators in this category help users evaluate loan options, understand debt service capacity, assess covenant compliance, and compare financing alternatives (traditional loans, SBA programs, equipment financing, invoice factoring, lines of credit). The focus is on providing CFO-grade metrics (DSCR, covenant headroom, NPV/IRR) that lenders and boards expect, not just basic payment calculations.

### Primary Personas

- **CFOs and Controllers**: Evaluating debt capacity and covenant compliance
- **SMB Owners and Founders**: Deciding between financing options for growth or equipment purchases
- **Lenders and Brokers**: Structuring proposals and pre-qualifying borrowers
- **Financial Advisors**: Helping clients compare financing alternatives

### Typical Decision Questions

- "Which loan structure is better for our cash flow: 5-year at 7.5% or 7-year at 8.2%?"
- "What is our Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) and how close are we to lender covenant thresholds?"
- "Should we pursue SBA 7(a) financing or a conventional term loan?"
- "Is it better to lease this equipment or finance the purchase?"
- "How does invoice factoring compare to a traditional line of credit in terms of effective cost and DSCR impact?"

## 2. Cash Flow & Liquidity Intelligence

### Purpose

This category addresses cash runway, timing gaps, working capital needs, and liquidity risks. Calculators in this category help users understand how long their cash will last, identify periods of cash stress, evaluate the impact of revenue or expense changes on runway, and assess working capital financing needs. The focus is on forward-looking liquidity analysis under multiple scenarios, not just historical cash flow reporting.

### Primary Personas

- **CFOs and Controllers**: Managing cash reserves and planning for liquidity needs
- **FP&A Analysts**: Modeling cash flow under different growth or stress scenarios
- **Founders and CEOs**: Understanding burn rate and runway for fundraising decisions
- **Lenders**: Assessing working capital needs and line of credit sizing

### Typical Decision Questions

- "How many months of runway do we have at our current burn rate?"
- "What happens to our cash position if revenue drops 20% for two quarters?"
- "How much working capital credit line do we need to cover seasonal gaps?"
- "At what point should we start fundraising or cutting costs to avoid running out of cash?"
- "How does our line of credit utilization pattern affect our liquidity and interest costs?"

## 3. Profitability & Pricing Intelligence

### Purpose

This category focuses on analyzing margins, breakeven points, pricing structures, and product/service profitability. Calculators in this category help users understand contribution margins, identify breakeven volume, evaluate the impact of discounting or price changes, and compare profitability across different pricing strategies. The focus is on unit economics and margin management, not full P&L forecasting.

### Primary Personas

- **CFOs and Controllers**: Monitoring margin health and pricing discipline
- **FP&A Analysts**: Modeling pricing scenarios and profitability tradeoffs
- **Revenue Leaders and Sales Managers**: Understanding the margin impact of discounts and volume deals
- **Founders and CEOs**: Evaluating product profitability and pricing strategy

### Typical Decision Questions

- "What is our breakeven volume for this product line?"
- "How do volume discounts affect our contribution margin and overall profitability?"
- "Which products or services are actually profitable after allocating variable costs?"
- "If we raise prices by 10%, how much volume can we afford to lose before profitability declines?"
- "What is our margin of safety, and how much buffer do we have above breakeven?"

## 4. Valuation & Deal Intelligence

### Purpose

This category provides simple, defensible valuation estimates and deal-impact views. Calculators in this category help users understand valuation ranges based on revenue or EBITDA multiples, assess the impact of new debt or equity on enterprise value, and evaluate acquisition or exit scenarios. The focus is on rough-order-of-magnitude valuation for planning purposes, not formal fairness opinions or DCF models.

### Primary Personas

- **Founders and CEOs**: Understanding business valuation for fundraising or exit planning
- **CFOs**: Evaluating the impact of financing decisions on equity value
- **Investors and Advisors**: Estimating valuation ranges for deal structuring
- **Buyers and Sellers**: Assessing whether a proposed valuation is reasonable

### Typical Decision Questions

- "What is a reasonable valuation range for our business based on industry multiples?"
- "How does taking on new debt affect our equity value and leverage ratios?"
- "What does this potential acquisition do to our overall leverage and valuation?"
- "How sensitive is our valuation to changes in revenue growth or EBITDA margins?"
- "What valuation might different types of buyers (strategic vs financial) assign to our business?"

---

## 5. Planning & Scenario Intelligence

### Purpose

This category enables what-if planning around growth initiatives, cost changes, and capital allocation decisions. Calculators in this category help users run scenarios (optimistic, realistic, conservative), understand sensitivity to key drivers (hiring, pricing, interest rates), and compare alternative strategies. The focus is on high-level scenario comparison within individual planning tools, not detailed line-item budgeting or multi-year strategic plans.

### Primary Personas

- **CFOs and Controllers**: Preparing board presentations with scenario analysis
- **FP&A Analysts**: Running sensitivity analysis on key business drivers
- **Founders and CEOs**: Evaluating strategic decisions (hiring plans, expansion, pricing changes)
- **Boards and Investors**: Understanding risks and upside potential across different scenarios

### Typical Decision Questions

- "What happens to our financials if we hire 10 additional people?"
- "How sensitive are we to interest rate changes on our variable-rate debt?"
- "Which scenario (aggressive growth vs conservative growth) balances revenue upside with acceptable risk?"
- "What is the financial impact of expanding into a new market vs deepening penetration in existing markets?"
- "How do different combinations of pricing, volume, and cost assumptions affect our cash flow and profitability?"

## Calculator Mapping Requirement

Each calculator PDR (as defined in Section 11) must map to **exactly one primary category** and optionally one secondary category. This mapping ensures that:
- Users can discover calculators by problem domain
- Tier behavior is consistent within categories (as defined in Section 2.4)
- Product roadmaps can be organized by category to address gaps
- Analytics can track usage and conversion patterns by category

For example, the "Business Loan + DSCR Intelligence Calculator" has a primary category of "Financing & Lending Intelligence" and could have a secondary category of "Cash Flow & Liquidity Intelligence" (since DSCR relates to cash flow capacity). However, its primary placement, tier behavior, and SEO positioning are determined by the primary category.
