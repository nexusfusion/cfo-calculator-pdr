# 2.4 Tier Behavior by Category

This section defines standard tier behavior patterns for each of the five calculator categories. Consistent tier behavior within categories ensures predictable user experience, simplifies development, and reinforces the value proposition of Pro and AI add-on tiers. Individual calculators may have minor variations, but they must follow these general patterns unless explicitly justified in their calculator-specific PDR (Section 11).

## 1. Financing & Lending Intelligence

Calculators in this category focus on structuring, comparing, and stress-testing business debt. Tier behavior emphasizes multi-scenario comparison and CFO-grade metrics (DSCR, covenant headroom, NPV/IRR) as the primary Pro tier differentiators.

### Free Tier Behavior

**What users can do**:
- Calculate payment amounts and total interest for a **single loan or financing scenario**
- View basic metrics: monthly payment, total interest paid, total cost of financing
- See high-level comparison to one alternative (e.g., SBA loan vs conventional loan, lease vs buy)
- Generate watermarked PDF or CSV export with "Powered by [Brand]" footer
- View ads and affiliate links (equipment lenders, SBA brokers)

**What's gated (Pro tier upgrade prompts)**:
- **DSCR and covenant headroom metrics** (locked with "Upgrade to unlock DSCR analysis")
- Detailed fee breakdowns (origination fees, prepayment penalties)
- Multiple loan scenarios side-by-side (Free tier limited to 1 saved scenario)
- NPV/IRR analysis (for lease vs buy, equipment financing)
- Clean exports without watermarks
- Scenario sharing with colleagues

### Pro Tier Behavior

**What unlocks**:
- **Multiple loan/facility scenarios** (up to 10 saved scenarios per calculator) with side-by-side comparison tables
- **Advanced metrics**: DSCR, debt service coverage ratios, covenant headroom, NPV/IRR (where applicable)

- **Clean exports**: Board-ready PDFs and banker-friendly CSVs without watermarks or ads
- **Scenario sharing**: Generate shareable links with view-only or edit permissions
- **Version history**: Track changes to scenarios over time (who edited, when)

### AI Tier Behavior

**What AI adds** (requires Pro tier + AI add-on):
- **Lender-style commentary**: "Your DSCR of 1.32 is above the typical lender threshold of 1.25, providing comfortable covenant headroom"
- **Risk threshold highlighting**: Warnings when DSCR is borderline or below typical thresholds; explanations of covenant tension
- **Tradeoff narratives**: "Scenario A has lower monthly payments but $12K higher total cost; choose if preserving cash flow is critical"
- **Lender perspective**: "Lenders typically require 1.25-1.50 DSCR; your current structure may face pushback"
- **Scenario suggestions**: "Consider extending the term from 5 to 7 years to reduce monthly payments and improve DSCR to 1.42"

## 2. Cash Flow & Liquidity Intelligence

Calculators in this category help users understand cash runway, timing gaps, and liquidity risks. Tier behavior emphasizes multi-scenario runway analysis and sensitivity views as Pro tier differentiators.

### Free Tier Behavior

**What users can do**:
- Calculate cash runway in months for a **single scenario** (current burn rate and cash balance)
- View basic metrics: monthly burn rate, months of runway remaining
- See simple cash flow projection (cash balance over time)
- Generate watermarked export with basic runway chart

**What's gated (Pro tier upgrade prompts)**:
- **Multi-scenario runway comparisons** (base case, downside, upside) with side-by-side charts
- Sensitivity analysis ("If revenue drops 20%, runway decreases from 12 to 8 months")
- Detailed cash flow breakdowns (inflows vs outflows by category)
- DSCR and coverage metrics (for line of credit or working capital tools)
- Clean exports without watermarks
- Scenario sharing

### Pro Tier Behavior

**What unlocks**:
- **Multi-scenario runway analysis** (up to 10 scenarios): base case, optimistic, conservative, stress test
- **Visual runway charts**: Line charts showing cash balance over time for each scenario, overlaid for comparison
- **Sensitivity views**: Tables or tornado charts showing impact of revenue changes, expense changes, or timing delays on runway
- **DSCR and coverage metrics** (for calculators involving debt or credit lines): impact of line of credit usage on liquidity and coverage ratios
- **Clean exports**: Board-ready PDFs with multi-scenario charts; CSV exports with monthly cash projections
- **Scenario sharing**: Share runway analysis with investors, board members, or CFO

### AI Tier Behavior

**What AI adds** (requires Pro tier + AI add-on):
- **Runway guidance narratives**: "You have 9.2 months of runway at current burn; consider starting fundraising or cost reduction by Month 6"
- **Risk warnings**: "Your downside scenario shows only 5 months of runway if revenue drops 20%; this is below the recommended 6-month buffer"
- **Suggested actions**: "To extend runway to 12 months, reduce monthly burn by $15K (cut discretionary spend) or increase monthly revenue by $25K"
- **Pattern insights**: "Businesses with similar burn rates typically raise capital when runway drops below 9 months"
- **Line of credit commentary**: "Your utilization of 85% limits flexibility; aim for 50-60% to preserve borrowing capacity in downturns"

## 3. Profitability & Pricing Intelligence

Calculators in this category analyze margins, breakeven points, and pricing structures. Tier behavior emphasizes multi-scenario pricing comparison and contribution margin analysis as Pro tier differentiators.

### Free Tier Behavior

**What users can do**:
- Calculate breakeven units and breakeven revenue for a **single price/volume scenario**
- View basic metrics: contribution margin per unit, breakeven units, breakeven revenue
- See simple gross margin percentage
- Generate watermarked export with basic breakeven summary

**What's gated (Pro tier upgrade prompts)**:
- **Multiple pricing/volume scenarios** (e.g., current pricing, +10% price increase, volume discount tier)
- **Contribution margin analysis** and **margin of safety** metrics
- Sensitivity charts showing impact of price changes or volume changes on profitability
- Side-by-side scenario comparison tables
- Clean exports without watermarks
- Scenario sharing

### Pro Tier Behavior

**What unlocks**:
- **Multiple pricing/discount scenarios** (up to 10 scenarios): compare current pricing, price increase, volume discount, bundle pricing
- **Advanced metrics**: Contribution margin per unit, contribution margin ratio, margin of safety (actual sales minus breakeven)
- **Visual sensitivity charts**: Bar charts or tornado charts showing how pricing or volume changes affect profitability
- **Scenario comparison tables**: Side-by-side view of breakeven units, contribution margin, and profit for each pricing scenario
- **Clean exports**: Board-ready PDFs with pricing analysis; CSV exports with scenario comparison data
- **Scenario sharing**: Share pricing analysis with sales team, CFO, or CEO for approval

### AI Tier Behavior

**What AI adds** (requires Pro tier + AI add-on):
- **Margin risk explanations**: "Your margin of safety is only 15%; a small revenue miss could push you below breakeven"
- **Discounting risk warnings**: "The 20% volume discount reduces your contribution margin from 40% to 28%; ensure volume increase justifies the margin sacrifice"
- **Pricing strategy narratives**: "Raising prices by 10% allows you to lose up to 18% of unit volume before profitability declines; your customer base is likely not that price-sensitive"
- **Sensitivity insights**: "Your profitability is highly sensitive to variable cost changes; a 5% increase in COGS reduces margin of safety from 25% to 12%"
- **Scenario recommendations**: "Scenario B (tiered pricing) balances volume and margin better than flat discounting"

## 4. Valuation & Deal Intelligence

Calculators in this category provide simple, defensible valuation estimates and deal-impact views. Tier behavior emphasizes multi-scenario valuation ranges and sensitivity analysis as Pro tier differentiators.

### Free Tier Behavior

**What users can do**:
- Calculate a **basic valuation range** from simple inputs (revenue or EBITDA, industry multiples)
- View single-scenario valuation estimate (e.g., "Your business is valued at $2.8M - $3.5M based on 3.5-4.5x EBITDA")
- See simple valuation drivers (revenue, EBITDA, multiple)
- Generate watermarked export with valuation range summary

**What's gated (Pro tier upgrade prompts)**:
- **Multiple valuation scenarios** (conservative, moderate, optimistic multiples or performance assumptions)
- **Sensitivity views**: charts showing how valuation changes with revenue, EBITDA, or multiple adjustments
- Detailed breakdowns (enterprise value, equity value, debt impact)
- Side-by-side scenario comparison
- Clean exports without watermarks
- Scenario sharing

### Pro Tier Behavior

**What unlocks**:
- **Multiple valuation scenarios** (up to 10 scenarios): different revenue assumptions, EBITDA margins, or multiples (strategic buyer vs financial buyer)
- **Visual sensitivity charts**: Bar charts or tornado charts showing valuation range under different assumptions
- **Scenario comparison tables**: Side-by-side view of enterprise value, equity value, implied multiples for each scenario
- **Debt impact analysis**: How new debt or equity affects valuation and leverage ratios
- **Clean exports**: Board-ready PDFs with valuation analysis; CSV exports with scenario data
- **Scenario sharing**: Share valuation estimates with investors, advisors, or potential buyers

### AI Tier Behavior

**What AI adds** (requires Pro tier + AI add-on):
- **Buyer perspective narratives**: "Strategic buyers may pay 5-6x EBITDA for your customer relationships and market position; financial buyers likely 3.5-4.5x given current growth rate"
- **Valuation driver insights**: "Your valuation is highly sensitive to EBITDA margin; improving from 15% to 18% increases valuation by $600K"
- **Deal context commentary**: "At 4.2x EBITDA, this valuation is above median for your industry (3.8x) but below top quartile (5.1x); justified if growth rate exceeds industry average"
- **Risk warnings**: "New debt of $500K reduces equity value from $2.8M to $2.3M; ensure cash flow supports debt service (check DSCR)"
- **Scenario recommendations**: "Scenario C (optimistic EBITDA, moderate multiple) is most defensible for board presentation; Scenario A (conservative) is most defensible for lender discussions"

## 5. Planning & Scenario Intelligence

Calculators in this category enable what-if planning around growth, costs, and capital allocation. Tier behavior emphasizes multi-scenario planning within individual tools as Pro tier differentiators.

**Important note**: Cross-calculator linked scenario sets (e.g., linking assumptions across Business Loan + Cash Runway + Margin calculators) are **Phase 3+ features** and not a v1 commitment (per Section 2.3). Cross-calculator AI narratives that synthesize insights across multiple calculators are also later-phase features. This section describes tier behavior **within individual planning calculators** only.

### Free Tier Behavior

**What users can do**:
- Run a **single scenario** within an individual planning calculator (e.g., "What if we hire 10 people?")
- View basic financial impact (revenue, expenses, cash flow, profitability for the scenario)
- See simple summary of inputs and outputs
- Generate watermarked export with single-scenario results

**What's gated (Pro tier upgrade prompts)**:
- **Multiple scenarios within a single planning tool** (e.g., plan vs downside, aggressive growth vs conservative growth)
- **Scenario comparison views**: side-by-side tables and charts comparing financial outcomes across scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis (impact of driver changes on outcomes)
- Advanced metrics (margin, runway, coverage ratios) within planning tools
- Clean exports without watermarks
- Scenario sharing

### Pro Tier Behavior

**What unlocks**:
- **Multiple scenarios within a single planning calculator** (up to 10 scenarios): base plan, upside, downside, stress test
- **Visual comparison charts**: Bar charts or line charts showing revenue, expenses, cash flow, or profitability across scenarios
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Tables or tornado charts showing impact of key driver changes (hiring plans, pricing, interest rates) on financial outcomes
- **Advanced metrics**: Contribution margin, cash runway, DSCR, or other CFO-grade metrics (depending on planning calculator type)
- **Clean exports**: Board-ready PDFs with multi-scenario planning analysis; CSV exports with scenario comparison data
- **Scenario sharing**: Share planning scenarios with board, investors, or CFO for review and approval

### AI Tier Behavior

**What AI adds** (requires Pro tier + AI add-on):
- **Planning narratives**: "Hiring 10 people increases expenses by $1.2M annually but extends runway by only 6 months if revenue grows as planned; downside scenario shows only 4 months of additional runway"
- **Risk and upside highlighting**: "Your upside scenario assumes 30% revenue growth; if this doesn't materialize, you'll face cash shortfall by Month 9"
- **Tradeoff explanations**: "Scenario B (aggressive hiring) maximizes revenue potential but increases burn risk; Scenario A (conservative hiring) preserves cash but may limit growth"
- **Sensitivity insights**: "Your plan is most sensitive to revenue growth rate; a 10% miss reduces cash runway from 18 months to 12 months"
- **Scenario recommendations**: "Scenario C balances growth and risk best for board presentation; maintain Scenario A as a contingency plan"

**Out of scope for Phase 1 AI**:
- Cross-calculator narratives (e.g., "Your loan scenario increases DSCR risk shown in the cash flow calculator")
- Automated scenario suggestions that pull data from multiple calculators
- AI-driven optimization across multiple linked calculators

These cross-calculator AI features are Phase 3+ considerations and require separate PDRs with technical feasibility and cost-benefit analysis.

## Summary and Application

These tier behavior patterns ensure consistency within categories while allowing individual calculators to differentiate on domain-specific features. Key principles:

1. **Free tier always single-scenario**: Limits user to one saved scenario and basic metrics
2. **Pro tier unlocks multi-scenario comparison and advanced metrics**: Side-by-side views, CFO-grade metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR, contribution margin, sensitivity), clean exports
3. **AI tier adds narrative interpretation**: Plain-language explanations, risk warnings, tradeoff analysis, scenario recommendations

Individual calculator PDRs (Section 11) must reference this section and justify any deviations from these standard patterns. Deviations are acceptable only if they:
- Increase Pro tier conversion potential
- Enhance user value without increasing development complexity
- Maintain consistency with the overall product philosophy (Section 1.1)
