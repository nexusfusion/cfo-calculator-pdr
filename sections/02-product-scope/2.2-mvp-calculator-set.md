## Summary and Next Steps

These eight MVP calculators represent the initial product offering for Phase 1. Each calculator must:
- Deliver CFO-grade accuracy (±0.1% tolerance vs reference models, per Section 1.6)
- Follow tier behavior patterns defined in Section 2.4 for their primary category
- Include 2-3 golden test scenarios in their individual PDRs (Section 11)
- Export board-ready PDFs and banker-friendly CSVs (per Section 1.3)
- Support Free, Pro, and AI add-on tiers as specified above

Development priorities within Phase 1 should favor calculators with the highest SEO/traffic potential (Business Loan + DSCR, SBA 7(a), Equipment Lease vs Buy, Cash Runway) to drive initial user acquisition, followed by calculators that demonstrate suite breadth and cross-selling opportunities (Breakeven, Valuation).
