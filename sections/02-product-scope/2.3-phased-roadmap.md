# 2.3 Phased Roadmap

The CFO Business Intelligence Calculator Suite will be delivered in four phases, progressing from platform foundation to MVP calculators to expansion and advanced planning capabilities. This phased approach manages development risk, enables early user feedback, and ensures that the platform architecture is solid before scaling the calculator portfolio.

---

## Phase 0: Platform Foundation

**Objective**: Build the shared infrastructure and core components that all calculators depend on. This phase delivers no user-facing calculators but establishes the technical foundation for rapid calculator development in Phase 1.

### Shared Calculation Engine and Formula Library

- **Versioned formula library**: TypeScript modules containing all financial formulas (amortization, DSCR, NPV/IRR, breakeven, etc.) with semantic versioning (e.g., `dscr_v1.0.0`)
- **Strongly typed interfaces**: Input and output types for all formulas with explicit units, currency, and validation rules
- **Regression test suite**: Golden test scenarios for all formulas, automated comparison against reference models with ±0.1% tolerance checks
- **Formula documentation**: Plain-language explanations of each formula, reference sources, edge case handling

### Base React/TypeScript UI Shell

- **Input panels**: Reusable form components for numeric inputs, dropdowns, toggles, sliders with built-in validation and tooltips
- **Results panel**: Standardized output tables, key metrics cards, comparison views (side-by-side scenarios)
- **Scenario tabs**: UI for creating, naming, saving, switching between scenarios
- **Warning and explanation components**: Reusable alert boxes for risk warnings, threshold violations, informational messages
- **Responsive layout**: Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet, mobile

### Export Service for PDFs and CSV/Excel

- **PDF generation**: Server-side PDF rendering with professional templates (headers, footers, page numbers, version stamps)
- **CSV/Excel export**: Structured data exports with explicit column headers, units, metadata rows
- **Metadata injection**: Automatic inclusion of timestamp, formula version, user ID, scenario name in all exports
- **Async generation**: Background job queue for large exports (multi-scenario PDFs, large CSV files) with progress indicators
- **Template customization**: Configurable branding (logos, colors, disclaimers) for B2B white-label clients

### Basic Analytics and Event Tracking

- **Telemetry SDK**: Client-side and server-side event tracking for calculator usage (which calculators, session duration, input distributions)
- **Conversion funnel tracking**: Events for Free → Pro conversion triggers (scenario save attempts, export attempts, advanced metric views)
- **Pseudonymous user IDs**: UUID-based user tracking with no PII in logs (per Section 1.6)
- **Dashboard integration**: Events sent to analytics database for Business Intelligence Dashboard (Section 1.8)

### WordPress/Shortcode Integration

- **WordPress plugin**: Embeddable calculator shortcodes for WordPress sites (e.g., `[smart-calculator id="business-loan"]`)
- **Iframe embed support**: Generic iframe embedding for non-WordPress sites
- **Feature toggles via shortcode parameters**: Enable/disable features per embed (e.g., `tier="free"`, `ai="disabled"`)
- **Domain whitelisting**: Security controls to restrict embeds to authorized domains (B2B access control)

**Phase 0 Success Criteria**:
- Formula library passes 100% of regression tests with ±0.1% tolerance
- Demo calculator (simple loan payment) renders in WordPress and standalone web app
- Export service generates board-ready PDF with proper formatting and metadata
- Analytics pipeline captures and stores calculator usage events

## Phase 1: MVP Suite (Calculators 1-8)

**Objective**: Launch the eight MVP calculators with Free/Pro/AI tier differentiation, enabling initial user acquisition, Pro tier conversions, and validation of product-market fit.

### Implement the 8 MVP Calculators

Each calculator must be implemented with:

- **Deterministic formulas and golden test scenarios**: All formulas validated against reference models; 2-3 golden test scenarios per calculator (as defined in Section 2.2)
- **Free/Pro feature gating**: Advanced metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR, multi-scenario comparison, sensitivity charts) locked in Free tier with upgrade prompts; unlocked in Pro tier (per Section 1.5 and Section 2.2)
- **Input validation and edge case handling**: Reject invalid inputs (negative amounts, nonsense rates); warn on unusual inputs (500% interest rate likely a typo); handle edge cases gracefully (zero cash flow, infinite DSCR)
- **Responsive UI**: Desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts for all calculators
- **Export functionality**: PDF and CSV exports with proper metadata and formatting (per Section 1.3 and Section 1.6)

**The 8 MVP calculators** (details in Section 2.2):
1. Business Loan + DSCR Intelligence Calculator
2. SBA 7(a) Loan Analyzer
3. Equipment Lease vs Buy Intelligence Calculator
4. Cash Runway & Burn Rate Calculator
5. Breakeven & Contribution Margin Analyzer
6. Invoice Factoring / AR Financing Intelligence Calculator
7. Line of Credit Utilization & Cost Analyzer
8. Simple Business Valuation (EBITDA/Revenue Multiple)

### Basic AI Narrative Integration for AI Add-On

- **AI commentary service**: Server-side service that generates plain-language narratives from calculator outputs (e.g., "Your DSCR of 1.32 is above typical lender thresholds...")
- **Prompt templates**: Pre-defined prompts for each calculator type, parameterized with calculator outputs and user inputs
- **LLM integration**: API integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar LLM provider; logging and cost tracking (per Section 1.6)
- **Fallback handling**: Timeout handling (10-second hard cap); fallback messages if AI service is unavailable
- **Disclaimers**: All AI-generated text includes "advisory only" disclaimers (per Section 1.4)
- **Initial scope**: AI narratives for 4-6 calculators in Phase 1 (prioritize Business Loan + DSCR, Cash Runway, Valuation for highest narrative value); remaining calculators can have stubbed AI responses or "AI coming soon" messages

### Launch on PlusOneCapital + SmartProfit-Style Frontends

- **SEO-optimized landing pages**: Dedicated landing page for each calculator with keyword-rich content, schema markup, example scenarios
- **Calculator directory page**: Master page listing all calculators by category (per Section 2.1) with search and filtering
- **Basic onboarding flows**: Sign-up prompts when Free tier users attempt to save scenarios or export; upsell messaging for Pro and AI add-on tiers
- **Free tier UX**: Watermarked exports, "Upgrade to Pro" prompts on advanced metrics, ad placement (per Section 1.5)
- **Pro tier UX**: Clean exports, multi-scenario support, advanced metrics unlocked, no ads
- **AI add-on UX**: Narrative commentary visible in results panel, "Powered by AI" indicators, opt-in settings

**Phase 1 Success Criteria**:
- All 8 calculators live and passing golden test scenarios with ±0.1% tolerance
- Free → Pro conversion rate of 3-5% within 90 days (per Section 1.5 business goals)
- At least 500 Free tier sessions/month from organic search across all calculators
- AI narratives generating for 4+ calculators with <10 second p99 latency
- Exports meeting quality standards (board-ready PDFs, banker-friendly CSVs per Section 1.3)

## Phase 2: Depth and Coverage Expansion

**Objective**: Expand the calculator portfolio within existing categories, enhance AI capabilities, and strengthen B2B/white-label offering. This phase deepens market coverage and increases Pro tier value.

### Add More Calculators Within Existing Categories

**Financing & Lending Intelligence**:
- **SBA 504 Loan Analyzer**: Similar to SBA 7(a) but for real estate and equipment purchases (two-loan structure with CDC participation)
- **SBA Working Capital Program Analyzer**: For lines of credit and seasonal financing under SBA programs
- **Commercial Real Estate Loan Calculator**: Mortgage-specific metrics (LTV, debt yield, cap rate impact)

**Cash Flow & Liquidity Intelligence**:
- **13-Week Rolling Cash Flow Planner**: Simplified weekly cash planning for businesses with tight liquidity (uses aggregated inputs, not transaction-level detail per Section 1.7 constraints)
- **Working Capital Needs Estimator**: Calculate optimal AR, AP, inventory levels and financing needs

**Profitability & Pricing Intelligence**:
- **Customer Profitability Analyzer**: Contribution margin by customer segment (aggregated inputs, no customer-identifiable data per Section 1.7)
- **Project ROI Calculator**: Simple NPV/IRR for capital projects or new product launches
- **Tiered Pricing Optimizer**: Compare profitability of different pricing tier structures (SaaS, subscription, volume discount models)

### Expand AI Narratives

- **Richer scenario comparison commentary**: AI explains differences between scenarios in plain language ("Scenario B has lower monthly payments but costs $12K more over the term; choose if cash flow is tight today")
- **Pattern-based suggestions across calculators**: "Users with similar DSCR profiles often extend loan terms to improve coverage ratios" (anonymized pattern detection, no PII)
- **Risk commentary**: AI highlights covenant tension, cash runway warnings, margin erosion risks with suggested actions
- **AI quality improvements**: Fine-tuned prompts, user feedback loops, A/B testing of narrative styles

### Enhance B2B/White-Label Capabilities

- **Tenant-level configuration**: B2B clients can configure default assumptions, branding, feature availability per tenant (multi-tenant SaaS architecture)
- **Theming and branding**: Custom logos, color schemes, footer disclaimers, domain-specific branding per B2B client
- **More granular feature toggles**: Enable/disable specific calculators, metrics, or AI features per tenant or per embed
- **API access**: RESTful API for B2B clients to integrate calculators into their own platforms (not just iframe embeds)
- **Self-hosted deployment option**: Docker/Kubernetes images for clients who require on-premise or private cloud deployment (per Section 1.4)

**Phase 2 Success Criteria**:
- 15+ calculators live (up from 8 in Phase 1)
- AI narratives available for all calculators with improved quality scores (measured via user feedback ratings)
- 5+ B2B white-label clients with custom branding and API integrations
- Pro tier ARPU increases by 20-30% due to expanded calculator portfolio and AI improvements

## Phase 3: Advanced Planning & Scenario Toolkit

**Objective**: Enable cross-calculator workflows, deeper planning capabilities, and board-ready multi-calculator exports. This phase transforms the suite from standalone calculators into an integrated decision-support platform.

### Cross-Calculator Scenario Sets

- **Linked scenarios across calculators**: Create a "scenario set" that links assumptions across Business Loan, Cash Runway, and Breakeven calculators (e.g., "Aggressive Growth" scenario applies consistent revenue and expense assumptions across all three)
- **Consolidated view**: Dashboard showing key metrics from multiple calculators in one view (DSCR, runway, margin) for a given scenario set
- **Change propagation**: Update revenue assumption in one calculator, automatically recalculate dependent calculators in the scenario set
- **Export scenario sets**: Board-ready PDF that combines outputs from 3-5 calculators into one cohesive report

**Note**: This is a Phase 3 feature and not a v1 commitment. Implementation depends on user demand validation in Phases 1-2 and technical feasibility assessment.

### Deeper Planning Tools

- **Multi-year high-level planning**: Simple 3-5 year planning tools using aggregated inputs (not line-item budgets per Section 1.7 constraints)
- **Plan vs downside comparisons**: Side-by-side comparison of base plan, upside scenario, and downside scenario across multiple years
- **Sensitivity modeling**: "What if" analysis across multiple drivers (revenue growth, margin, interest rates, hiring plans) with visual tornado charts or sensitivity tables

### Advanced Exports

- **Multi-tab Excel exports**: Excel files with Summary tab + detailed tabs for each calculator (formulas preserved for user customization)
- **Board-ready packs**: Combine 3-5 related calculators into one PDF document (e.g., "Financing Options Pack" with Business Loan + DSCR, Line of Credit, and Cash Runway analysis)
- **Custom export templates**: B2B clients can define custom export templates with their own branding, sections, and formatting
- **Email delivery**: Schedule automatic exports (monthly, quarterly) delivered via email for recurring workflows (per Section 1.2 Day-2 usage contexts)

### Evaluate Multi-Currency and Limited ERP Integrations

- **Multi-currency support**: Allow mixed-currency scenarios or multi-currency consolidation (requires FX rate feeds, hedging logic)
- **Read-only ERP integrations**: Optional CSV import or read-only API connections to QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite for automated financial data pull (avoids manual input)

**Important**: These capabilities are explicitly out-of-scope for v1 per Section 1.7. Phase 3 evaluation requires:
- **Separate PDR**: Full product design review with technical architecture, data flows, error handling
- **Risk assessment**: GDPR/CCPA implications of ERP integrations; regulatory risk of multi-currency modeling
- **Demand validation**: Sufficient user requests and willingness to pay for these features
- **Resource justification**: Engineering capacity and opportunity cost vs other Phase 3+ features

**Phase 3 Success Criteria**:
- Cross-calculator scenario sets available to Pro tier users (if implemented based on demand validation)
- 50%+ of Pro tier users export multi-calculator board packs (demonstrates value of integrated workflows)
- Multi-currency and ERP integration decisions documented in separate PDRs with go/no-go recommendation
- Advanced exports (multi-tab Excel, board packs) used by 30%+ of Pro tier users

## Roadmap Flexibility and Sequencing

This phased roadmap is a planning framework, not a rigid contract. Sequencing within phases should be adjusted based on:
- **User demand signals**: If SBA 504 calculator gets high search volume and user requests, prioritize it in Phase 2 over other calculators
- **Pro conversion data**: If AI narratives drive significant Pro → AI add-on conversion, accelerate AI expansion in Phase 2
- **B2B pipeline**: If multiple B2B prospects request specific features (e.g., API access, self-hosted deployment), prioritize those capabilities
- **Competitive pressure**: If competitors launch similar calculators, accelerate comparable offerings to maintain differentiation

**Key principle**: Each phase must reach its success criteria before advancing to the next phase. Shipping Phase 1 calculators with poor quality or low user engagement would undermine trust and make Phase 2 expansion ineffective.
