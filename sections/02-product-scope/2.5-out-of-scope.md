# 2.5 Out-of-Scope Calculators for V1

This section explicitly defines calculator types that are **out of scope** for the initial MVP suite (Phase 1) and early expansion phases (Phase 2). These boundaries protect the product from scope creep, manage development risk, and ensure focus on the core value proposition: CFO-grade financial intelligence calculators using aggregated scenario inputs.

## Out-of-Scope Calculator Types

### Detailed Tax Calculators

**Examples**:
- Entity-specific corporate tax optimization tools (C-corp vs S-corp, partnership vs LLC)
- Sales tax and use tax compliance calculators with multi-state nexus rules
- Multi-jurisdiction tax engines (US federal + state, Canada federal + provincial, cross-border)
- Advanced tax planning tools (tax loss harvesting, depreciation optimization, R&D credits, renewable energy credits)

**Reasoning**:
- **Legal and tax expertise required**: Tax calculators require partnership with CPAs, tax attorneys, or tax software providers to ensure accuracy and compliance. The suite's calculation engine is designed for financial metrics, not tax law interpretation.
- **Regulatory risk**: Tax rules change frequently (annual updates to tax codes, rates, deductions). Providing incorrect tax guidance exposes the product to liability and user complaints.
- **Multi-jurisdiction complexity**: Supporting US federal + 50 states + Canada federal + 13 provinces requires maintaining 60+ tax rulesets, each with annual updates. This is beyond the initial US/CA scope defined in Section 1.7.
- **Out of core competency**: The suite's differentiator is CFO-grade financial metrics (DSCR, NPV/IRR, contribution margin), not tax compliance. Tax calculators are a different product category with different competitive dynamics.

**Alternative approach**: Calculators may include **basic tax assumptions** (e.g., user-specified corporate tax rate, interest deductibility) for planning purposes, with clear disclaimers that results are estimates and users should consult tax professionals. Formal tax optimization tools are out of scope.

### Payroll-Specific Calculators Tied to Hourly/Time-Tracking Data

**Examples**:
- Employee-level payroll cost calculators (hourly wage, overtime, benefits per employee)
- Time-and-attendance-based labor cost planners
- Shift scheduling cost optimizers
- Payroll tax calculators (FICA, unemployment, withholding by employee)

**Reasoning**:
- **Different data model**: The suite is designed for **aggregated scenario inputs** (total payroll expense, total headcount), not employee-level data. Supporting employee-level inputs requires a different database schema, UI patterns, and privacy controls.
- **Integrations out of v1 scope**: Payroll calculators are most valuable when integrated with payroll systems (Gusto, ADP, Paychex) or time-tracking systems (TSheets, Deputy). Per Section 1.7, automated integrations are out of v1 scope.
- **PII exposure risk**: Employee-level payroll data (names, wages, SSNs) introduces PII that the suite is designed to avoid (per Section 1.4 and 1.7). Aggregated payroll totals (e.g., "total monthly payroll: $120K") are acceptable; individual employee records are not.
- **Niche use case**: Payroll-specific tools serve HR and operations teams, not CFOs and finance teams (the suite's primary personas per Section 1.2).

**Alternative approach**: Calculators may include **aggregated labor cost inputs** (e.g., "If we hire 10 people at average salary $70K, total payroll increases by $700K/year"). Individual employee payroll planning is out of scope.

### Full-Blown Budgeting Systems with Month-by-Month Line-Item Planning

**Examples**:
- Detailed operating budgets with 50+ expense line items by month
- Department-level budget allocation and tracking tools
- Budget vs actual variance analysis with drill-down to transaction level
- Multi-year capital budgets with project-by-project tracking

**Reasoning**:
- **Too granular for "aggregated scenarios only" constraint**: Per Section 1.7, the suite uses aggregated scenario inputs, not line-item detail. Full budgeting systems require line-item planning (salaries by person, software subscriptions by vendor, travel by department), which conflicts with the calculator paradigm.
- **Competes with existing budgeting platforms**: Tools like Adaptive Insights, Planful, Cube, and spreadsheet templates already serve the detailed budgeting market. The suite differentiates by offering **fast, scenario-based decision support**, not comprehensive budget management.
- **High maintenance burden**: Line-item budgets require ongoing updates, variance explanations, and reconciliation against actuals. This shifts the product from "calculator" to "system of record," which is out of scope per Section 1.7.
- **UI complexity**: Detailed budgeting requires spreadsheet-like UIs with hundreds of input cells, copy-paste, bulk editing, and formula authoring. The suite's UI is optimized for **guided input forms** with 10-30 inputs per calculator, not spreadsheet replacement.

**Alternative approach**: Calculators may include **high-level planning tools** (e.g., "What if we increase total operating expenses by 15%?") using aggregated inputs. Detailed line-item budgeting is out of scope.

### ERP or GL-Integrated Tools That Ingest Detailed Accounting Exports

**Examples**:
- Calculators that auto-import trial balance data from QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite
- Tools that parse general ledger exports (CSV, Excel) and categorize accounts
- Automated financial statement generators from accounting system data
- Real-time sync with accounting platforms for live financial dashboards

**Reasoning**:
- **No automated accounting/ERP imports in v1**: Per Section 1.7, the suite does not integrate with accounting systems in v1. Users manually enter aggregated financials (total revenue, total COGS, total operating expenses).
- **Fragile integrations**: Accounting API integrations are brittle (authentication issues, schema changes, rate limits, inconsistent data quality across clients). Supporting multiple accounting platforms (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage, FreshBooks) multiplies support burden.
- **Out of scope for decision-support use case**: The suite targets **scenario-based planning** (e.g., "What if we take on $200K in new debt?"), not **historical reporting** (e.g., "What were our actual financials last month?"). Accounting integrations are valuable for historical data, less so for forward-looking scenarios.
- **Data quality risks**: Accounting data often requires cleanup (uncategorized transactions, duplicate entries, reconciliation errors). Auto-importing messy data into calculators would produce unreliable outputs and erode trust.

**Alternative approach**: Calculators accept **manual input of aggregated financials** (e.g., user types "Total Q1 Revenue: $500K" based on their P&L report). Automated imports may be reconsidered in Phase 3+ (per Section 2.3) with rigorous error handling and reconciliation workflows.

### Industry-Specific Deep Models Beyond Simple Aggregated Inputs

**Examples**:
- Hospital cost accounting (DRG-based reimbursement, bed utilization, labor pools)
- Complex project finance (oil & gas, infrastructure, real estate development with multi-phase cash flows)
- Restaurant-specific models (table turns, labor scheduling, food cost by menu item)
- SaaS-specific models (CAC payback by channel, cohort LTV, churn by segment, expansion revenue)

**Reasoning**:
- **Requires domain-specific expertise**: Industry-specific models require deep knowledge of industry metrics, accounting conventions, and business drivers. Building these well requires partnerships with industry experts or hiring domain specialists.
- **Limited to niche markets**: Each industry-specific calculator addresses a narrow audience (e.g., hospital CFOs, restaurant owners). The MVP suite targets **cross-industry problems** (business loans, cash flow, breakeven) to maximize addressable market.
- **Phase 2+ consideration**: Industry-specific calculators may be added in later phases if user demand justifies development cost and there's a clear monetization path (e.g., B2B partnerships with industry associations, SaaS platforms, or lenders).
- **Conflicts with "simple aggregated inputs" principle**: Many industry-specific models require detailed inputs (menu items, customer cohorts, project milestones) that conflict with the suite's focus on aggregated scenarios.

**Alternative approach**: The MVP suite focuses on **cross-industry calculators** that work for any business (loans, cash flow, margins, valuation). Industry-specific depth is out of scope unless justified by demand and a viable business model.

## Process for Reconsidering Out-of-Scope Calculators

These calculator types are **not permanently banned**—they can be revisited once the core platform and MVP calculators (Phase 1) are shipping and stable. However, any of these require:

1. **Separate PDR (Product Design Review)**: A full PDR (following the Section 11 template) documenting use cases, technical design, tier behavior, business justification, and risk assessment.

2. **Demand validation**: Evidence of user demand (search volume, user requests, competitive analysis showing market opportunity). "Seems like a good idea" is insufficient; must demonstrate that this calculator would drive user acquisition, Pro conversions, or B2B revenue.

3. **Resource justification**: Clear opportunity cost analysis. Building a detailed tax calculator or industry-specific model consumes engineering and product resources that could be spent on expanding the core calculator portfolio, improving AI narratives, or enhancing B2B capabilities. The return must justify the investment.

4. **Risk review**: Any calculator involving tax advice, PII, or regulatory complexity requires review by legal, compliance, and security teams. Calculators that introduce new data exposure (employee payroll, accounting integrations) require SOC 2 compliance updates and privacy policy changes.

5. **Pilot or Beta phase**: Out-of-scope calculator types should launch as Beta (limited release to subset of users) to validate demand and quality before full production rollout. This limits downside risk if the calculator fails to gain traction.

## Closing Statement

The out-of-scope boundaries defined in this section protect the product from over-complexity, regulatory risk, and market dilution. The suite's strength is **CFO-grade financial intelligence using simple, aggregated inputs**—not comprehensive budgeting, tax compliance, or industry-specific depth. By maintaining focus on the core value proposition (speed, defensibility, embed-ability per Section 1.1), the suite can deliver exceptional quality in its target problem space rather than mediocre quality across too many domains.

These boundaries will be revisited periodically (quarterly product roadmap reviews) to ensure they remain appropriate as the market, user needs, and competitive landscape evolve. However, the default stance is **maintain focus** unless compelling evidence justifies expansion into these more complex calculator types.
